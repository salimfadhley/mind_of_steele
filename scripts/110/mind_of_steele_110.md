Synopsis: This epiosode explores Richard Vobes beliefs concerning the chemtrail cospiracy theory. We show how Vobes cyncally exploits belief in this obviously silly conspiracy theory to extract sympathy and money from his fans. 

### Mind of Steele Episode 110

Link 1: What is the most absurd conspiracy theory? Could it be Mark Steele’s claim that streetlights are actually 5G energy weapons? Or the flat-earthers, convinced that their skepticism outweighs two millennia of geographic understanding? Perhaps the anti-vaxxers, who see the greatest medical breakthrough in human history as a sinister threat?

While all of these are undeniably ridiculous, none quite reach the sheer delusion of chemtrails.

The idea that jet contrails are actually toxic chemicals deliberately sprayed into the atmosphere is one of the most persistent conspiracy theories. Anyone with a basic grasp of chemistry knows that burning jet fuel produces carbon dioxide and water vapor, which condenses into visible contrails. These trails linger until turbulence disperses them—simple physics, nothing more.

Yet to believers, contrails are proof of a vast, malevolent operation. Every overcast sky is evidence of deliberate weather manipulation. A clear day? Proof that “they” took a break. The mental gymnastics required to maintain this belief are staggering.

Few illustrate this mindset better than Richard Vobes.

> Clip 1 - Richard Vobes: We had two days of sunshine down here on the south coast, full days that is, where obviously the pilots were having a day off or the planes were being refueled or serviced or indeed they were flying somewhere else. And still there are people out there thinking no no no this is just normal weather, this is still normal weather. Well wake up ladies and gentlemen because the evidence is all over the place. And they're slightly concerned that people like me and many others have been craning our necks, looking up at the sky and going oh hang on a second what are those streaks through the sky that the back end of aeroplanes seem to be chucking out more than just contrails.

Link 2: Being a chemtrail believer means constantly living in anxious confusion about something that has always been around—weather. Richard Vobes lives in Worthing, a seaside town on the southern coast of Britain, at the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic climate is famously unpredictable, a fact familiar to anyone who's spent time in Britain or Ireland.

But to believe in chemtrails, you have to pretend this isn't true. You must ignore the obvious explanation—that unpredictable weather is normal for an island surrounded by ocean—and instead convince your followers that something ancient and ordinary is suddenly suspicious. To sell this illusion convincingly, you need a fancy, scary-sounding name. Something like 'Geoengineering.'

> Clip 2 - Richard Vobes:  Many of us have been calling that geoengineering and perhaps we're using it by the more popular name of of chemtrails, chemical trails in the sky.

Link 3: This is just the latest spin on the chemtrail conspiracy theory. If you’d asked a conspiracy enthusiast in the 1960s—possibly mid-acid-trip—they’d likely tell you chemtrails were a mind-control plot or a Soviet scheme to feminize American men. That’s where the whole “tinfoil hat” thing comes from.

What’s great about the chemtrail theory, at least for conspiracy theorists, is its versatility—it can mean whatever they’re worried about at the time.

Richard himself isn’t entirely sure what chemtrails are supposed to do, beyond knowing they’re definitely bad. He dismisses mainstream climate science, refusing to believe burning fossil fuels could gradually affect our climate. Yet simultaneously, he thinks a single jet could somehow control the day’s weather or even an entire season.

This contradiction lies at the heart of chemtrail belief. You’re supposed to accept that jet exhaust—mostly carbon dioxide and water vapor—is powerful enough to manipulate weather instantly, but somehow believe massive, worldwide carbon emissions can’t possibly affect our atmosphere at all.

Richard might not grasp the basic chemistry here, but he’s absolutely certain chemtrails are part of a secret climate-control agenda to offset the carbon dioxide we’re releasing.

> Clip 3 - Richard Vobes:  It's CO2, the gas of life is is being raised into the atmosphere. My god isn't that what we need? Are we not carbon based life forms? It's all our fault, we're farting or at least the cows are and we're producing CO2, we're actually exhaling CO2 into the atmosphere and the gas of life is the...

Link 4: Richard loves calling CO₂ the “gas of life”—a catchy phrase that ultimately means nothing. Carbon dioxide isn’t uniquely life-giving, at least not any more than methane or oxygen or nitrogen or any other gas that’s consumed or produced by living things.

Water might be essential to life, but that doesn’t mean drowning is enjoyable.

The whole “gas of life” thing is just flimsy rhetoric. It was invented in the early 2000s by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an American think tank funded by the petroleum industry. Their infamous public-service announcement attempted to rebrand carbon dioxide from a climate-changing greenhouse gas into something wholesome and essential. The message: if a small amount is necessary, surely pumping massive amounts into the atmosphere must be even better.

> Clip 4 - Competitive Industry Institute PSA:  There's something in these pictures you can't see. It's essential to life. We breathe it out, plants breathe it in. It comes from animal life, the oceans, the earth and the fuels we find in it. It's called carbon dioxide, CO2.

Link 5: The Competitive Enterprise Institute suggests it's your patriotic duty to burn as much fossil fuel as humanly possible. Just look at those wholesome images of cheerful kids blowing dandelions—clearly, there's no such thing as too much of a good thing.

So honestly, worrying about fiddling with the atmosphere by unleashing fossil carbon seems positively un-American. Only the most committed buzzkill would dare deny humanity the freedom—no, the joy—of burning all the carbon we can get our hands on.


> Clip 5 - Competitive Industry Institute PSA: - politicians want to label carbon dioxide a pollutant. Imagine if they succeed. What would our lives be like then? Carbon dioxide, they call it pollution. We call it life.

Link 6: According to Richard, chemtrails are actually a form of climate engineering secretly carried out by misguided liberals to fix global warming—something he insists isn’t even happening.

Much like the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Richard believes the entire idea of global warming—the notion that an atmosphere’s composition can trap or reflect heat—is ridiculous. He dismisses the idea that one gas might absorb more radiation than another; as far as he’s concerned, a gas is a gas, and his common sense tells him there’s no essential difference between one kind and another. All those lab-coated boffins should just shut up. Richard considers the possibility of unchecked greenhouse gases turning Earth into a Venus-like inferno to be pure fantasy—yet he’s utterly convinced of chemtrails, treating it as proven fact.

And Richard’s strongest evidence linking aircraft contrails to geoengineering? Other conspiracy theorists believe it too. Because in Richard’s world, consensus among conspiracy theorists apparently counts as hard scientific proof.

> Clip 6 - Richard Vobes: World-wide there has been twice as many mentions of geoengineering this year on x, formerly known as twitter, than the last six months in 2023. Well of course that's because people are waking up and going hang on what are you doing to the skies? You do seem to be dimming them. Yes so in other words we'll go and block out the sun and we can see you know there they are with their sprays but is that exactly what is going on? We of course we've had pilots on my show revealing the stuff that is actually being sprayed.

Link 7: Richard did indeed feature two people claiming to be pilots on his show—but considering the disguised voices, you have to wonder if these mysterious characters are really who they say they are.

Richard doesn’t exactly have a stellar record when it comes to validating guests or their claims. With his rush to produce hours of content each day, corners inevitably get cut. The most obvious shortcut Richard takes is skipping any sort of fact-checking or verification.

He insists it’s up to viewers to “do their own research,” but since these pilots appeared anonymously, didn’t show their faces, and disguised their voices, there’s absolutely no legitimate way for viewers to verify their claims. Everything they said can only be accepted on blind faith—which conveniently shields Richard from accountability.

> Clip 7 - Anonymous Pilot : Competitive Industry Institute PSA: We've seen the main constituents are barium, strontium, aluminium oxide.

Link 8: As far as I can tell, Richard has never actually explained why he believes these claims. Why would aircraft contrails contain barium, strontium, and aluminium oxide anyway?

You’d think if these elements were really being sprayed, someone might have tried analyzing the trails from a distance, perhaps through spectroscopic analysis, to verify the claim. But oddly enough, none of the chemtrail enthusiasts ever seem interested in doing real science.

Instead, they just repeat these chemical names without understanding them. But consider this: if you combine the chemical symbols for barium (Ba) and aluminium (Al), you get ‘Baal’—the name of an ancient pagan deity. Coincidence? Well, in Richard’s world, there are no coincidences.

For Richard, even the vaguest suggestion of a sinister connection gives him license to broadcast indignation to his quarter-million YouTube followers.

> Clip 8 - Richard Vobes: The idea that we would muck about by injecting anything, any particles of any nature into the atmosphere because we do know do we not know that what goes up comes down? That people will be starting to breathe in things? Are they really as stupid as all that as to think no no it won't have any harmful effect on humans? How do we know? Where are the tests? Where's the evidence? Where who's taking liability if one person gets ill? If one person dies who's taking the liability? Who's going to go to prison? What individual person or man or woman who signed off this who from these corporations are doing are going to take that personal liability t`o

Link 9: This short rant from Richard is like a crash course in logical fallacies—each stacked precariously upon the next. We start off strong with begging the question, as Richard assumes from the outset that chemtrails exist, without providing any real evidence. Then he quickly moves into affirming the consequent—arguing that if something harmful was sprayed into the sky, it would inevitably harm people; therefore, any illness must prove the spraying is real.

He also manages to squeeze in an appeal to ignorance by demanding “where are the tests?” as if an absence of evidence to the contrary automatically proves him right. Richard then pivots to a classic slippery slope—claiming that even a single particle sprayed into the atmosphere inevitably leads directly to mass poisoning and death. And finally, he throws in an appeal to emotion, stirring up fear and anger by suggesting some faceless bureaucrat is callously endangering lives, yet mysteriously nobody’s going to prison for it.

Each fallacy builds on the last, creating a towering, fragile structure of nonsense—just waiting for a gentle breeze, perhaps from a passing Boeing 747, to topple it completely.

Richard’s argument isn’t just flimsy; it’s a full-on carnival of bad reasoning. But Richard isn’t speaking to an audience trained in critical thinking. To follow Richard, you’ve already abandoned skepticism, reason, and logic long ago—leaving you unable to differentiate between genuine expertise and the fevered ramblings of some bloke down at the pub.

Today’s guest, Ian Livingstone, illustrates this perfectly—another self-proclaimed expert whose only real qualification is the vividness of his own imagination.

> Clip 9 - Ian Livingstone: Pretty much all weather is now manufactured. All weather is manufactured now 100% on a daily basis all over the world. Very few clouds you see in the sky are natural. There is a way of kind of disguising this to some extent what I call induced cumulus. It's a term I coined basically induced obviously because they're false they're fake they're creative and cumulus because they look a bit like cumulus clouds because they're sort of fluffy and you know kind of slightly cloud shaped. I don't have direct proof of this but everything I've worked at over the last 10 years has led me to believe this so it is to some extent speculative but I'm pretty 100% on this. The Met Office have some kind of mainframe computer that controls this antenna system.

Link 10: This is a common trope among conspiracy theorists—the idea that we should respect their expertise simply because they’ve spent years obsessing over their particular delusion.

Ian Livingstone confidently claims he can distinguish between real clouds and fake ones floating side-by-side in Britain’s skies. But if “all weather is manufactured,” wouldn’t that mean every cloud is artificial? And what even makes a cloud “fake” or “real”? After all, a cloud is simply air where water vapor has cooled enough to form tiny droplets. When exactly does this natural atmospheric process become “fake”?

Presumably, Livingstone means the clouds are artificial because they’re created unnaturally—but surely any cloud made of condensed water droplets is just as real as another, no matter how it formed. Or maybe he genuinely believes in an entirely new category of cloud—one that looks exactly like a real cloud but is as fake as a seven-pound note: a counterfeit cloud secretly composed of something other than water droplets.

And then there’s this mysterious “mainframe.” Exactly how does a computer, even one hooked up to some special antenna, create clouds? I’ve checked IBM’s product catalog and found nothing suitable. Perhaps Livingstone imagines this computer functioning like Lex Luthor’s sinister supercomputer in Superman III, instantly analyzing weather patterns and firing invisible beams of electromagnetic energy to ionize the atmosphere, forcing clouds to spontaneously form or disperse at will.

Or maybe he’s picturing Eddie, the overly cheerful shipboard computer from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, politely chatting with individual water droplets and gently persuading them into perfect cloud formations through relentless positivity and good manners.

Even more disturbingly, perhaps Ian imagines the clouds controlled by AM, the sadistic AI from Harlan Ellison’s I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, sadistically creating storms, heatwaves, or catastrophic droughts—clouds deliberately shaped into menacing patterns to torment humanity.

The real issue here is that Ian Livingstone has absolutely no understanding of what a computer actually is or does. His entire concept of computing is borrowed from fiction and fantasy, which perfectly explains how he’s reached such absurd conclusions.

> Clip 10 - Ian Livingstone: So it charges the atmosphere, ionizes the atmosphere. As the atmosphere becomes ionized all these little plastic fibers form these little fluffy clouds.

Link 11: Ian Livingstone never provides a handy chart or any practical method to identify which clouds are real and which are entirely fake.

We no longer know the provenance of our own clouds. As children, we learned about basic cloud types: cumulo-nimbus, alto-cirrus, cirro-stratus. Were all those clouds fake, too? And who exactly was in on the deception? From those lab-coated boffins at the Met Office—supposedly predicting weather while secretly controlling it—all the way down to my Year 7 geography teacher. Was everything we learned just an elaborate lie designed to pass off ersatz clouds as authentic?

You could easily drive yourself mad staring at the sky, anxiously questioning if every fluffy formation overhead is natural or secretly handcrafted by an unseen conspiracy. And if we’ve unknowingly lived our lives under fake skies, what else might be fake? Could our entire existence have been just a dream all along?

Thankfully, we have dedicated people like Mr. Livingstone—presumably unemployed, given the time required—to painstakingly classify every cloud drifting above the British Isles into neat categories: “real,” “fake,” or “we’ll never know.”

It’s that uncertainty that’s truly terrifying. The nightmare scenario isn’t just fake clouds—it’s the possibility that we might never know what’s authentic and what’s been conjured from a mainframe’s mysterious antenna.

Paradoxiacally, According to Richard, though, maybe dreams are our only real proof:

> Clip 11 - Richard Vobes: I had a dream. I had a dream that this was going on and in the dream somebody stood up and says who gives them the right? Who gives them the right to block out the sun?

Link 12: Some dreams are power fantasies—moments when the dreamer imagines he isn’t the pathetic wretch he truly is. In Richard’s dream, he’s at the heart of a political movement, heroically reclaiming the skies for ordinary, sensible people who simply want to breathe fresh air and drive their diesel vans unmolested by meddling liberal climate activists—the type who fret endlessly about carbon footprints and melting glaciers.

Richard, a man who’s spent his life as an outsider, fantasizes about finally being recognized as a true leader—someone whose authority is unquestioned. It’s why he’s reinvented himself as the sovereign citizen influencer we see today.

This particular dream Richard describes is likely one he experiences nightly. Rather than an ageing, penniless, unemployed actor living in a smoke-stained, run-down house he can barely afford, he imagines himself as a charismatic rural leader. In his fantasy, he’s the kind of influential figure who might casually share a pint of Landlord’s Best Bitter with Jeremy Clarkson, as they both passionately agree that cars and fossil fuels are definitely not the problem.

Did I say peaceful revolution? Recently, Richard’s fantasies have taken a disturbingly violent turn:

> Clip 12 - Richard Vobes: And in these big sort of army maneuvering vehicles they went to the airports and they burst their way in and they nobbled the aeroplanes so they couldn't take off. They grabbed all of the pilots out of the cockpit and they were forcing them together in big groups, put them against the firing liners. They got cannons out and they were blasting the aeroplanes out of the skies.

Link 13: Richard’s dreams are the stuff of nightmares. In his imagination, death squads roam freely, rounding up anyone with even the slightest technical expertise or intellectual curiosity. Pilots, climate scientists, BBC weather presenters, geography teachers—even pharmacists administering vaccines—are dragged from their workplaces and homes, forced into crude firing lines by Richard’s fanatical followers.

Bodies pile up in shallow graves, victims of Richard’s fantasy, where intelligence and critical thought have become capital crimes. The triumphant cheers of his new peasant revolt echo across fields stained red, celebrating the violent triumph of ignorance over reason.

Of course, Richard isn’t the first person to dream of violently purging an intellectual class. His fantasy has a disturbing historical precedent—the Khmer Rouge’s infamous Killing Fields, where doctors, teachers, and anyone who wore glasses were executed simply for appearing educated. Like Pol Pot, Richard dreams of a society purged of anyone who might question his new orthodoxy.

And Richard’s braying fans eagerly cheer on these calls for destruction because, given half a chance, they’d gladly join the purge themselves. The streets of England, under their control, would resemble those of Rwanda, Bosnia, and Cambodia—places where riots of violent passion erupted, leaving nothing but devastation in their wake.

This is the real Richard—not the bespectacled juggler and mime-artist dressed in tweed and cravat. This blood-soaked fantasy reveals who Richard truly is and what he genuinely desires. It’s who he could become, if given even the slightest chance.
