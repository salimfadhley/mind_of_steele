Synopsis: This epiosode explores Richard Vobes beliefs concerning the chemtrail cospiracy theory. We show how Vobes cyncally exploits belief in this obviously silly conspiracy theory to extract sympathy and money from his fans. 

### Mind of Steele Episode 110

Link 1: What is the most absurd conspiracy theory? Could it be Mark Steele’s claim that streetlights are secretly 5G energy weapons? Or perhaps the flat-earthers, convinced their misplaced hyper-skepticism outweighs two millennia of geographic knowledge? Or maybe the anti-vaxxers, who see the greatest medical breakthrough in human history as a sinister plot?

While each of these is undeniably ridiculous, none quite matches the sheer delusion of chemtrails.

Anyone with a basic grasp of chemistry knows burning jet fuel produces carbon dioxide and water vapor, which condenses into visible contrails under certain conditions. These trails linger until natural factors—like temperature, humidity, altitude, and turbulence—cause them to disperse. It’s straightforward science.

Yet chemtrail believers insist that if a contrail persists for “too long,” it’s actually a chemtrail. Exactly how long is “too long”? Nobody seems to know. Should all trails vanish at precisely the same rate? Chemtrail enthusiasts are never clear on these details. Instead, they treat the mere existence of persistent contrails as undeniable proof of a vast conspiracy.

Every overcast sky becomes evidence of deliberate weather manipulation. A clear day? Proof that “they” took a break. This is the ultimate conspiracy: a plot so enormous and logistically complicated it would embarrass even a Bond villain. A plan executed openly, in plain sight, for decades—and yet, somehow, without leaving behind a single shred of direct evidence. It’s a globalist plot, staggeringly huge—so vast, apparently, that Labour and Conservative, Democrat and Republican alike must all secretly agree to say nothing, despite being incapable of agreeing on literally anything else.

Who could orchestrate such devilish intrigue and deception? It’s enough to make anyone as paranoid as Richard Vobes.

> Clip 1 - Richard Vobes: We had two days of sunshine down here on the south coast, full days that is, where obviously the pilots were having a day off or the planes were being refueled or serviced or indeed they were flying somewhere else. And still there are people out there thinking no no no this is just normal weather, this is still normal weather. Well wake up ladies and gentlemen because the evidence is all over the place. And they're slightly concerned that people like me and many others have been craning our necks, looking up at the sky and going oh hang on a second what are those streaks through the sky that the back end of aeroplanes seem to be chucking out more than just contrails.

Link 2: Being a chemtrail believer means constantly living in anxious confusion about something that has always been around—changeable weather. Richard Vobes lives in Worthing, a seaside town on Britain’s southern coast, right at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic climate is famously changeable, as anyone who’s spent time in the British isles knows well.

We have accurate weather forecasts that can predict the weather two weeks into the future: Chemtrail believers must therefore assume these forecasts aren’t predictions at all, but actual plans. Clearly, the Met Office must be working in cahoots with whichever sinister forces are secretly controlling the skies—otherwise, how could meteorologists reliably predict something as allegedly mysterious and ineffable as the weather?

To sustain belief in chemtrails, you have to ignore the obvious: that changeable weather is perfectly normal for an island surrounded by ocean, or that aircraft contrails naturally freeze and sometimes become visible before eventually dispersing. 

To sustain belief in chemtrails, you have to imagine we’re all victims of a horrifying experiment, where the sky itself is counterfeit—a toxic simulation of the weather we should naturally experience. Chemtrail believers insist these sinister forces openly justify their actions through ‘geoengineering’—the supposed intentional manipulation of Earth’s climate, carried out in plain sight under the pretense of combating global warming. Yet, paradoxically, believers often think they alone possess the unique ability to look up.

Is the rest of humanity is incapable of noticing obvious streaks across the sky?

> Clip 2 - Richard Vobes:  Many of us have been calling that geoengineering and perhaps we're using it by the more popular name of of chemtrails, chemical trails in the sky.

Link 3: This is just the latest spin on the chemtrail conspiracy theory. If you’d asked a conspiracy enthusiast in the 1960s—possibly mid-acid-trip—they’d likely tell you chemtrails were a mind-control plot or a Soviet scheme to feminize American men.

What's great about the chemtrail theory, at least for conspiracy theorists, is its versatility—it can mean whatever they're worried about at the time.

Richard himself isn’t entirely sure what chemtrails are supposed to do, beyond knowing they’re definitely bad. He dismisses mainstream climate science, refusing to believe that the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide from two centuries of global industrial activity could possibly alter the thermodynamic properties of our planet. Yet, simultaneously, he's convinced that a single aircraft overhead could instantly control the day's weather—or even an entire season.

This isn't just a contradiction—it's an astonishingly stupid belief. To sustain it, believers must abandon all sense of perspective, ignoring the obvious: that while both aircraft and global industry emit carbon dioxide, a single jet is utterly insignificant compared to the immense scale of industrial emissions worldwide. Chemtrail believers are literally suggesting that one tiny speck flying overhead has more atmospheric influence than the entire industrial output of humanity combined.

> Clip 3 - Richard Vobes:  It's CO2, the gas of life is is being raised into the atmosphere. My god isn't that what we need? Are we not carbon based life forms? It's all our fault, we're farting or at least the cows are and we're producing CO2, we're actually exhaling CO2 into the atmosphere and the gas of life is the...

Link 4: Richard loves calling CO₂ the 'gas of life'—a catchy phrase that ultimately means nothing. It's exactly the kind of slogan you repeat when you've stopped thinking altogether, which suits Richard perfectly. As a conspiracy theory influencer, Richard boasts proudly about not owning a television, as if that alone proves he thinks independently. But his idea of 'doing his own research' involves binge-watching endless hours—possibly decades—of conspiracy videos on BitChute and Rumble, absorbing the same lazy rhetoric from other conspiracy theorists.

Carbon dioxide isn’t uniquely life-giving—no more than methane, oxygen, or nitrogen, all gases consumed or produced by living things. Breathe too much CO₂, and you'll pass out or die. Water is essential too, but that doesn’t mean drowning is fun.

The whole 'gas of life' phrase wasn’t even Richard’s original thought. It’s a cynical marketing slogan invented in the early 2000s by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an American think tank funded by the petroleum industry. Their infamous public-service announcement attempted to rebrand carbon dioxide from a problematic greenhouse gas into something wholesome and patriotic.

> Clip 4 - Competitive Industry Institute PSA:  There's something in these pictures you can't see. It's essential to life. We breathe it out, plants breathe it in. It comes from animal life, the oceans, the earth and the fuels we find in it. It's called carbon dioxide, CO2.

Link 5: The Competitive Enterprise Institute suggests it's your patriotic duty to burn as much fossil fuel as humanly possible. Just look at those wholesome images of cheerful kids blowing dandelions—clearly, there's no such thing as too much of a good thing.

So honestly, worrying about fiddling with the atmosphere by unleashing fossil carbon seems positively un-American. Only the most committed buzzkill would dare deny humanity the freedom—no, the joy—of burning all the carbon we can get our hands on.

> Clip 5 - Competitive Industry Institute PSA: - politicians want to label carbon dioxide a pollutant. Imagine if they succeed. What would our lives be like then? Carbon dioxide, they call it pollution. We call it life.

Link 6: Much like the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Richard thinks global warming is a hoax—not because he denies the atmosphere is changing, but because he simply doesn’t think those changes matter. In Richard’s worldview, the idea that altering the atmosphere’s composition could significantly change its thermal properties is absurd. To him, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen—it’s all just air. The notion that different gases might absorb or reflect heat differently is beyond his comprehension.

If you genuinely believe there’s no meaningful difference between gases, why would you care about carbon dioxide levels at all? In Richard’s simplistic logic, the entire concept of climate change collapses because he dismisses the fundamental science behind it.

Yet paradoxically, Richard is utterly convinced chemtrails—allegedly made from these same irrelevant gases—can profoundly alter the weather. His strongest evidence linking aircraft contrails to geoengineering? Other conspiracy theorists believe it too. Because in Richard’s world, consensus among conspiracy theorists apparently counts as hard scientific proof.

> Clip 6 - Richard Vobes: World-wide there has been twice as many mentions of geoengineering this year on x, formerly known as twitter, than the last six months in 2023. Well of course that's because people are waking up and going hang on what are you doing to the skies? You do seem to be dimming them. Yes so in other words we'll go and block out the sun and we can see you know there they are with their sprays but is that exactly what is going on? We of course we've had pilots on my show revealing the stuff that is actually being sprayed.

Link 7: Richard did indeed feature two people claiming to be pilots on his show—but considering the disguised voices, you have to wonder if these mysterious characters are really who they say they are.

Richard doesn’t exactly have a stellar record when it comes to validating guests or their claims. With his rush to produce hours of content each day, corners inevitably get cut. The most obvious shortcut Richard takes is skipping any sort of fact-checking or verification.

He insists it’s up to viewers to “do their own research,” but since these pilots appeared anonymously, didn’t show their faces, and disguised their voices, there’s absolutely no legitimate way for viewers to verify their claims. Everything they said can only be accepted on blind faith—which is how Richard reeally wants his followers to treat him.

> Clip 7 - Anonymous Pilot : Competitive Industry Institute PSA: We've seen the main constituents are barium, strontium, aluminium oxide.

Link 8: As far as I can tell, Richard has never explained why he believes these claims—or how they could possibly work. Why would aircraft contrails contain barium, strontium, and aluminium oxide? These are exotic substances, not incidental by-products. And jet fuel is a standardized commodity: it’s refined, inspected, and distributed globally. Yet Richard wants us to believe these metals are secretly added to commercial fuel—without anyone noticing.

Where are these mystery additives mixed in? Who’s responsible for introducing them? Nobody has ever filmed the facilities where these heavy metals are supposedly loaded onto planes. There’s no whistleblower from the thousands of engineers, baggage handlers, mechanics, and fuel technicians working daily at airports worldwide. Not one credible document, not one reliable image, not a single verifiable statement to support it.

And where exactly are these particles stored on the aircraft? Commercial planes are familiar machines. They have luggage holds, fuel tanks, and not much else. There’s no hidden compartment labelled "secret poison dust." If you’re going to claim aircraft are spraying chemicals into the sky, at least propose a storage method that fits the design of the plane.

But conspiracy theories thrive on vagueness. So instead, Richard just repeats the chemical names—barium, strontium, aluminium oxide—as though chanting them is enough. And if you combine barium (Ba) and aluminium (Al), you get "Baal," the name of an ancient pagan deity. Coincidence? Well, in Richard’s world, there are no coincidences.

For him, even the faintest whiff of a sinister connection gives him license to broadcast indignation to his quarter-million YouTube followers.

> Clip 8 - Richard Vobes: The idea that we would muck about by injecting anything, any particles of any nature into the atmosphere because we do know do we not know that what goes up comes down? That people will be starting to breathe in things? Are they really as stupid as all that as to think no no it won't have any harmful effect on humans? How do we know? Where are the tests? Where's the evidence? Where who's taking liability if one person gets ill? If one person dies who's taking the liability? Who's going to go to prison? What individual person or man or woman who signed off this who from these corporations are doing are going to take that personal liability t`o

Link 9: This short rant from Richard is like a crash course in logical fallacies—each stacked precariously upon the next. We start off strong with begging the question, as Richard assumes from the outset that chemtrails exist, without providing any real evidence. Then he quickly moves into affirming the consequent—arguing that if something harmful was sprayed into the sky, it would inevitably harm people; therefore, any illness must prove the spraying is real.

He also manages to squeeze in an appeal to ignorance by demanding “where are the tests?” as if an absence of evidence to the contrary automatically proves him right. Richard then pivots to a classic slippery slope—suggesting that even a single particle sprayed into the atmosphere inevitably leads directly to mass poisoning and death. And finally, he throws in an appeal to emotion, stirring up fear and anger by suggesting some faceless bureaucrat is callously endangering lives, and getting off scott-free.

Each fallacy builds on the last, creating a towering, fragile structure of nonsense—just waiting for a gentle breeze, perhaps from a passing exaust Boeing 747, to topple it completely.

Richard’s argument isn’t just flimsy; it’s a full-on carnival of bad reasoning. But Richard isn’t speaking to an audience trained in critical thinking. To follow Richard, you’ve already abandoned skepticism, reason, and logic long ago—leaving you unable to differentiate between genuine expertise and the fevered ramblings of some bloke down at the pub.

Today’s guest, Ian Livingstone, illustrates this perfectly—another self-proclaimed expert whose only real qualification is his inability to distinguish fact from unhinged fantasy.

> Clip 9 - Ian Livingstone: Pretty much all weather is now manufactured. All weather is manufactured now 100% on a daily basis all over the world. Very few clouds you see in the sky are natural. There is a way of kind of disguising this to some extent what I call induced cumulus. It's a term I coined basically induced obviously because they're false they're fake they're creative and cumulus because they look a bit like cumulus clouds because they're sort of fluffy and you know kind of slightly cloud shaped. I don't have direct proof of this but everything I've worked at over the last 10 years has led me to believe this so it is to some extent speculative but I'm pretty 100% on this. The Met Office have some kind of mainframe computer that controls this antenna system.

Link 10: This is a common trope among conspiracy theorists—the idea that we should respect their expertise simply because they’ve spent years obsessing over their particular delusion.

Ian Livingstone claims he can distinguish between real clouds and fake ones floating side-by-side in Britain’s skies. But if “all weather is manufactured,” doesn’t that mean every cloud is artificial? What even makes a cloud “real”? A cloud is simply an area where water vapor condenses into droplets. When does that natural process become “fake”?

Presumably, Ian means some clouds are unnatural—but if they’re still made of water droplets, how are they any less real? Or maybe he believes in an entirely new category of cloud—one that looks perfectly normal but is secretly synthetic, like a counterfeit £7 note.

And then there’s the mysterious “mainframe with an antenna.” Exactly how does a computer, even a powerful one, create clouds? I’ve checked IBM’s catalogue—no dice.

Maybe Ian imagines a computer like Lex Luthor’s sinister weather-altering supercomputer from Superman III, firing beams of logic into the sky. Or perhaps it’s like Eddie, the overly cheerful shipboard computer from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, politely persuading water droplets into fluffy cloud shapes through sheer annoying optimism. Or, more disturbingly, maybe he envisions AM, the sadistic AI from Harlan Ellison’s I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, tormenting humanity by shaping storms and droughts into malevolent expressions of hate.

But here’s the real irony: if this magical mainframe can directly ionize the atmosphere and manufacture clouds on demand, then why do we even need chemtrails? Ian’s theory makes the entire chemtrail narrative obsolete. Which is it, then? Aircraft spraying heavy metals—or computers beaming clouds into existence? Or is it both?

It’s as if Ian, like Richard, is stacking fantasies on top of fantasies—a conspiracy lasagna, 

At the base, you’ve got a chewy sheet of chemtrails—old. Then comes the meat: a rich ragu of weather-controlling mainframes, antenna arrays, and electromagnetic pulses. On top of that, a smooth béchamel of pseudo-scientific jargon—ionization, geoengineering, atmospheric manipulation—poured liberally over every wild claim to give it a veneer of credibility. Baked  until bubbling with paranoia and topped with a fine crust of righteous indignation.

The result? A piping-hot dish of total nonsense—delicious, comfort food to wackaloons and the terminally deluded.

> Clip 10 - Ian Livingstone: So it charges the atmosphere, ionizes the atmosphere. As the atmosphere becomes ionized all these little plastic fibers form these little fluffy clouds.

Link 11: Ian Livingstone never provides a handy chart or any practical method to distinguish which clouds are real and which are entirely fake.

We no longer know the provenance of our own clouds. As children, we learned about basic cloud types—cumulo-nimbus, alto-cirrus, and cirro-stratus. Were all those clouds fake too? And who exactly was in on the deception? From the lab-coated boffins at the Met Office—supposedly predicting weather while secretly controlling it—to my Year 7 geography teacher, Mr. Mills: was he in on the scam, or merely an innocent patsy—a pawn of Big Cloud?

Was everything we learned just an elaborate lie designed to pass off ersatz clouds as authentic?

You could easily drive yourself mad, staring at the sky and anxiously wondering whether every fluffy formation overhead is natural or secretly handcrafted by an unseen conspiracy. And if we’ve unknowingly lived our lives under fake skies, what else might be fake? Could our entire existence be nothing more than a dream?

Thankfully, we have dedicated people like Mr. Livingstone—presumably unemployed, given the time required—to painstakingly classify every cloud drifting above the British Isles into neat categories: “real,” “fake,” or “we’ll never know.”

Yet it’s that uncertainty which is truly terrifying—not just the fear of fake clouds, but the creeping suspicion that nothing around us is truly real: not the weather, not the sky, nor even our own thoughts. In a world where facts vanish like contrails, how can anyone hope to fight back?

Thankfully, Richard Vobes offers his own answer. He had a dream. In his vision, every child rises up against the deadly chemtrails, casting off the toxic fumes from the ass-end of every 747 and reclaiming a sky free from corporate and governmental manipulation. Their tiny voices unite in a rallying cry that galvanizes the entire nation behind Richard Vobes and against chemtrails.

> Clip 11 - Richard Vobes: I had a dream. I had a dream that this was going on and in the dream somebody stood up and says who gives them the right? Who gives them the right to block out the sun?

Link 12: Some dreams are power fantasies—moments when the dreamer imagines he isn’t the pathetic wretch he truly is. In Richard’s dream, he’s at the heart of a political movement, heroically reclaiming the skies for ordinary, sensible people who simply want to breathe fresh air and drive their diesel vans unmolested by meddling liberal climate activists—the type who fret endlessly about carbon footprints, particulates and melting glaciers.

Richard, a man who’s spent his life as an outsider, fantasizes about finally being recognized as a true leader—someone whose authority is unquestioned. It’s why he’s reinvented himself as the sovereign citizen influencer we see today.

This particular dream Richard describes is likely one he experiences nightly. Rather than an ageing, penniless, unemployed actor living in a smoke-stained, leaky house he can barely afford, he imagines himself as a charismatic revolutionary folk hero.

But did you expect a peaceful revolution? Recently, Richard’s fantasies have taken a disturbingly violent turn:

> Clip 12 - Richard Vobes: And in these big sort of army maneuvering vehicles they went to the airports and they burst their way in and they nobbled the aeroplanes so they couldn't take off. They grabbed all of the pilots out of the cockpit and they were forcing them together in big groups, put them against the firing liners. They got cannons out and they were blasting the aeroplanes out of the skies.

Link 13: Richard’s dreams are the stuff of nightmares. In his imagination, death squads roam freely, rounding up anyone with even the slightest technical expertise or intellectual curiosity. Pilots, climate scientists, BBC weather presenters, geography teachers—even pharmacists administering vaccines—are dragged from their workplaces and homes, forced into firing lines by Richard’s fanatical followers.

Bodies pile up in shallow graves, victims of Richard’s fantasy, where education and critical thought have become capital crimes. The triumphant cheers of his new peasant revolt echo across fields stained red. Vobes' stormtroopers celebrate the violent triumph of ignorance over reason.

Of course, Richard isn’t the first person to dream of purging an intellectual class. His fantasy has a disturbing historical precedent—the Khmer Rouge’s infamous Killing Fields, where doctors, teachers, and anyone who wore glasses were executed simply for appearing educated. Like Pol Pot, Richard dreams of a society purged of anyone who might question his ideas.

And Richard’s braying fans eagerly cheer on these calls for destruction because, given half a chance, they’d gladly join the massacre themselves. The streets of England, under their control, would resemble those of Rwanda, Bosnia, and Cambodia—places where riots of violent passion erupted, leaving nothing but devastation in their wake.

This is the real Richard—not the bespectacled juggler and mime-artist dressed in tweed and cravat. This blood-soaked fantasy reveals who Richard truly is and what he genuinely desires. It’s who he could become, if given even the slightest chance.
