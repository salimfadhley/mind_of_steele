 > We had two days of sunshine down here on the south coast, full days that is, where obviously the pilots were having a day off or the planes were being refueled or serviced or indeed they were flying somewhere else. And still there are people out there thinking no no no this is just normal weather, this is still normal weather. Well wake up ladies and gentlemen because the evidence is all over the place. And they're slightly concerned that people like me and many others have been craning our necks, looking up at the sky and going oh hang on a second what are those streaks through the sky that the back end of aeroplanes seem to be chucking out more than just contrails.



>  Many of us have been calling that geoengineering and perhaps we're using it by the more popular name of of chemtrails, chemical trails in the sky.



> It's CO2, the gas of life is is being raised into the atmosphere. My god isn't that what we need? Are we not carbon based life forms? It's all our fault, we're farting or at least the cows are and we're producing CO2, we're actually exhaling CO2 into the atmosphere and the gas of life is the...



> There's something in these pictures you can't see. It's essential to life. We breathe it out, plants breathe it in. It comes from animal life, the oceans, the earth and the fuels we find in it. It's called carbon dioxide, CO2.



> Now some politicians want to label carbon dioxide a pollutant. Imagine if they succeed. What would our lives be like then? Carbon dioxide, they call it pollution. We call it life.

> World-wide there has been twice as many mentions of geoengineering this year on x, formerly known as twitter, than the last six months in 2023. Well of course that's because people are waking up and going hang on what are you doing to the skies? You do seem to be dimming them. Yes so in other words we'll go and block out the sun and we can see you know there they are with their sprays but is that exactly what is going on? We of course we've had pilots on my show revealing the stuff that is actually being sprayed.

> We've seen the main constituents are barium, strontium, aluminium oxide.



> The idea that we would muck about by injecting anything, any particles of any nature into the atmosphere because we do know do we not know that what goes up comes down? That people will be starting to breathe in things? Are they really as stupid as all that as to think no no it won't have any harmful effect on humans? How do we know? Where are the tests? Where's the evidence? Where who's taking liability if one person gets ill? If one person dies who's taking the liability? Who's going to go to prison? What individual person or man or woman who signed off this who from these corporations are doing are going to take that personal liability to

 > pretty much all weather is now manufactured. All weather is manufactured now 100% on a daily basis all over the world. Very few clouds you see in the sky are natural. There is a way of kind of disguising this to some extent what I call induced cumulus. It's a term I coined basically induced obviously because they're false they're fake they're creative and cumulus because they look a bit like cumulus clouds because they're sort of fluffy and you know kind of slightly cloud shaped. I don't have direct proof of this but everything I've worked at over the last 10 years has led me to believe this so it is to some extent speculative but I'm pretty 100% on this. The Met Office have some kind of mainframe computer that controls this antenna system.



> So it charges the atmosphere, ionizes the atmosphere. As the atmosphere becomes ionized all these little plastic fibers form these little fluffy clouds.



> I had a dream. I had a dream that this was going on and in the dream somebody stood up and says who gives them the right? Who gives them the right to block out the sun?



>  And in these big sort of army maneuvering vehicles they went to the airports and they burst their way in and they nobbled the aeroplanes so they couldn't take off. They grabbed all of the pilots out of the cockpit and they were forcing them together in big groups, put them against the firing liners. They got cannons out and they were blasting the aeroplanes out of the skies.
