 Hello and welcome back to the channel thank you for joining me in another of my wonderful interviews. Now as you know on this channel we've been talking about the stuff they've been doing in the sky. Have you looked up? Have you seen it? Of course you have. You know what's going on and we feel pretty impotent about doing something about it. Well I want to find out more and so I was reached out by a couple of very lovely chaps who I've been talking to behind the scenes for a couple of weeks. These are pilots. Now they want to keep their identity naturally hidden for obvious reasons. They work within the industry and they know what's going on but they are prepared to speak and this is a chance for you and I to find out a little more about the real murky world of the chem trails, the climate engineering, the stuff they're doing in the skies. So ladies and gentlemen I'm only going to give you their first names and we've also digitized their voices and if it's not digitized enough you may find that even my voice has been digitized in order to protect their identity so I hope you'll bear with us. So first of all I'd like to introduce Eve. Hello Eve.



 Yes good evening my name is Eve. I am a commercial pilot. I have been for just over 25 years.



 I flew 10 years in freight and then the rest of 15 years on business jets and so I have extensively traveled all around Europe, America, Canada, the Middle East and as far as Singapore and I'm based in Frankfurt and my original country is Belgium.

 Thank you very much Eve and the second pilot who we're going to talk to is Russ. Hello Russ.



 Hello Richard thanks for having us on your show. I'm Russ. I've had a lifetime in aviation starting off firstly in the military and I moved on to commercial flights which include passengers and cargo and currently I'm working in the private sector both the UK and into Europe.



 Well thank you very much both of you for joining me. This is a great privilege of myself and it's going to be fascinating for the audience to find out exactly what is going on. As I said at the beginning we're all aware now I think and a lot of people are waking up to the fact that the skies are not what they were perhaps I don't know 40 years ago maybe they've been doing a long time but we've certainly seen a huge amount of this spraying. I'd like to find out from you both A) what it is they're doing, what they're spraying and if you have any idea about who's doing it why they're doing it and what the what the motive is these are some of the questions and of course finally what we can do to put an end to this because if we're all breathing in whatever is being sprayed that potentially is damaging our health and that's not a good thing for anybody especially as none of us has asked them to do that as far as I know.



 So who would like to kick off with what they're spraying and perhaps why?



 Yes I can answer that so Richard so what they're spraying we've all around Europe we have had tests done from the dust on your car from the dust on roofs and I've noticed they came trails personally for about the last 10 years so they have been tested if you go or to a website that I'll give you initially it is geoengineeringwatch.org that's geoengineeringwatch.org a lot of confirming information can also be found on that website so we have had many samples tested from various laboratories where they have mass spectrometers and the main constituents are barium,



 strontium,



 aluminium oxide the first two are carcinogenic aluminium oxide promotes Alzheimer's disease amongst other things and there are various microplastics up to 2% uranium and graphene oxide which we all know about these tend to be the basic elements in what they're spraying the justification for it they say and we're talking the New World Order globalists etc etc is to dim the sun because it's climate change or whatever they want to call it next week is to dim the sun and to insidiously poison everything it is the depopulation program it all leads back to that it leads back to the World Health Organization it leads back to the WEF the WEF at Davos and the main players who are sponsoring this are the Bill Gates Foundation and various others but this is in the Agenda 2030 as in the Agenda 2021 it's well documented in the Johns Hopkins University agendas they are all publicly available so it essentially does two things it is to block out the sun and to insidiously poison everything

 and just by blocking out the Sun of course you're you're actually depleting the amount of vitamin D that people can receive and also of course prohibiting plants from growing and if not plants then animals and consequently humans

 precisely and yes it's the animals are eating the grass it's in the grass we've been speaking to a lot of farmers as I say I'm from Belgium and a lot of the farmers there are reporting all sorts of problems with animals particularly newborn animals such as lambs and yes it's starting to affect everything and it is insidious and of course your doctor when you go to you have something wrong they have no idea where it's from

 yes and this has been going we know from at least the 1940s but I've had reports that that a hot air balloons were sort of mucking about with weather testing in the 1880s or something

 yes also it's in the public domain if people search for this there are hundreds of geoengineering patents have been applied for by a variety of companies from around the world and again if it takes a bit of research but if you do the research you'll find that the main sponsors for a lot of these companies all go back to the same sources which is some of the Soros foundations the Bill Gates foundations and so on it gets a little bit more involved because with a lot of the metal particulates in what they're spraying both at around about 10 to 15 thousand feet the higher level altitude spray that they're doing is mainly contaminants in the fuel we dismiss that to begin with because we thought the hot section of the engine will just melt everything but in actual fact what they're putting into the fuel it has a higher melting point of around about 900 degrees and hot engines hot sections of the engines tend to burn around seven to eight hundred degrees so but much of these spray applications that you can see aircraft doing actually doesn't go through the fuel some of it's in the fuel a very small amount but a lot of it is actually external nozzles so harp which I think everybody has now heard about there are various sites around the world this is high frequency but it's they're using thousands of watts so it does affect the ionosphere and having the metal particulates in the ionosphere already they can then cause different pressure or heat domes as they call it which then manipulates the jet stream which then picks up more water as it has a longer sea track and then when they collapse the heat dome the jet stream then comes over the UK over northern Europe and we have two to three times the normal rainfall this is all done by design

 when people look up and they see the aircraft flying overhead the immediate thought I suppose to many who are awake to what's going on is that these have been either fitted covertly or with the pilots knowledge to normal commercial flights is that the case or are these special airplanes doing this

 it's a mixture of both actually the initial culprits were freighter aircraft that have been converted we've done a lot of research into this in in Europe and we're finding there's a company who supply freighter aircraft called ASL they have actually supplied some of these companies sorry some of these aircraft at least some of these aircraft to various companies around Europe freighter companies who then applied for the conversions which are fairly very simple to do in the UK there's a couple of companies that we've also been keeping an eye on they very simply have either a roll-on roll-off system which is containerized like a freighter aircraft we have so it's a palette with a pump wiring a container with the chemicals in they get loaded onto the aircraft they get sorted into position an engineer will connect them all up and he'll get airborne the other aircraft have permanent tanks already fitted and again they're deliberately and willfully fitted so the CIA in each country have approved these systems so the CIA know about what they're doing we've also looked into the company's air operators certificates and some of these companies have more than one and some of them for instance are allowed to spray their oil spill response they their legitimacy is that they can spray detergents of low level over the sea onto an oil slick but in actual fact when you think well how many oil slicks were there around Europe or around the world in the last 20 years it's been minimal so that's raised my suspicion that's how I got onto this many years ago the AOC also says that some of these operators can spray pesticides over wooded areas and clearly that's in violation of the AOC because they're the main most cities don't have wooded areas so yeah it's it's been going on for quite some time it's just that we're now starting to notice

 so let me bring Russ on if I may Russ where I am down on the south coast near Brighton we're clearly very close to Gatwick Airport so we see a lot of planes going overhead some days more than others are obviously spraying some have your con trails and you can easily tell the difference how many planes Russ are operating this and are they operating over let's just take Great Britain I'm sure they're operating across the rest of the world with other contracts etc but how many operating planes are operating in any one time

 well it's very difficult to know the exact numbers Richard but through our investigation it's clear that they tend to operate in a set pattern that set pattern you have to understand is all controlled by international as well as the UK air traffic service we also know that the they are talking to the military operators the National air traffic service NATS as it's called both military and civil operators actually sit side by side in one control room what happens is a flight plan would be filed they would then have the if you like then prior knowledge of the routes of these aircraft are going to take altitude speed direction etc and what we're finding and this is very important for your viewers to understand many people use the flight tracking apps in particular flight radar 24 there are others out there but it's been proven that these do not deliberately they are being blocked from the customers being blocked from seeing the aircraft flying that's why you can look out in the sky and physically see you know the big grid patterns building as these planes are flying non-commercial routes they're not flying the normal patterns that anybody can get hold of an aviation route chart and have a look at where they should be they're not following these flight paths but they're being controlled by both military and civil controllers what they're doing is they obviously can see the aircraft for safety reasons and to keep and you know get them through but the problem is that the the acts won't let Joe public see them so that's why you'll see one with a trail maybe three or four and they tend to come through into a half a dozen like a squadron at a time coming through in waves building these patterns particularly in front of the Sun the more you witness this you'll realize that's their aim with the what they call the solar radiation management and then within a few minutes to a few hours you'll see the sky just cloud over and if you don't get the rain you're lucky but it that's why we're suffering with this lack of it I mean D amongst other things so the aircrafts are being hidden from view from these tracking acts the other thing to point out is that internationally there's a system called QRA that's quick reaction alert through NATO it's called the NATO air policing system and in America it's called norad the idea of that is is to defend countries from attack so if an aircraft for whatever reason doesn't show on a radar system or it's lost its radio contact with a controller etc they would then initiate QRA which involves scrambling fighter jets in the UK that's coins be Lincoln share and lossy mouth in Scotland to literally get up there find out what the aircrafts doing because he's not talking to a controller or he's not on a radar or he's not following the track he should be doing and they would then decide whether they need to intercept or whatever so the important thing to remember is that these aircraft are coming through with prior permission because the RAF in the UK are not being scrambled to intercept so that's how deep this whole thing goes that shows the involvement international airspace restrictions and control as well as the CIA here in the UK

 and they're doing it daily you know so so often I mean that these days you never seem to think these pilots get a day off or occasionally you get the odd day off and you think oh if only we knew what the rotor was like the pilots rotor was we could plan our holidays around them is it true I spoke to Ian Simpson who's done a lot of research on this and he was saying that they'll put one substance out then another plane will put another substance out and then in the air the two substances come together and a bit like aryl dite the glue one being the catalyst will then create a the third effect as it were is that is that how these chemicals work

 that appears to be exactly how they do it particularly as I previously mentioned when you see half a dozen or more come through the trails do seem to be of a different shall we say composition and if that's a very good description just like aryl dite you mix the two together to get the end result and then of course has been previously mentioned if they want to then move the jet stream and change the weather system to attack for example a particular area of the country for safe farming and make it extremely wet for a short period or indeed the other way make it extremely dry then they'll fire up half or 5g or doppler radar systems that would manipulate the nanoparticles in those trails and hence they can control the weather and the jet stream accordingly

 do we know when they switch on things like harp so that it starts to use the vibrational technology whatever it is to start doing that do we know are we able to recognize say the pattern in the clouds that has been manipulated from the ground

 yes indeed there is a particular pattern which is I call it macro sky I don't know if you'll bear an advocate to the video but macro sky is very very fine ripples in the sky they say well the metrological term is that it's caused by frequency waves in the upper atmosphere that is true the thing is of course if you want to do something covertly without people caught me not what you're doing you're going to make it look as natural as possible but there are time and time again examples of where they've sprayed and then they've manipulated everybody's witnessed and photographed and video this mackerel cloud and the mackerel cloud is confirmation that harp has been used or indeed 5g or doppler radar and

 I'm just looking now on just on ordinary Google images and we can see samples on on the line here of mackerel sky

 yeah that's the give away it's very difficult to obviously know if he's mackerel genuinely natural natural next sorry mackerel or it's been half a minute manipulated but again it normally coincides just within a few hours of trying occurring

 right yeah let's go back to Eve's one of the things that is particularly worrying is of course as as you mentioned the poisonous effect of this that people are breathing this stuff in do you think the the companies that are doing this know that we're breathing this in that it's affecting humans do you think they know that there is the bigger agenda behind it or do you think they just believe that they're working for the climate sake to save the planet and radiate the sunlight back into space

 that's a good question and it's one that I've come across many times before the answer is maybe when they started out on this they saw it as a business opportunity let's not ask too many questions and in short answer to that question I would say yes they fully realize what's they're doing anybody once you found out the constituent parts of what you're spraying anybody can then look it up you can Google it if you have to and you can find out what the net effect of these chemicals will have on mankind human life plant life and so on and the pilots the other tangential to that question I would say the other question I get asked is do the pilots know what they're doing yes they do 100%



 if you have dangerous goods on board which these chemicals will be classed as dangerous goods the captain has to have something called a no-tock which is a notice to captain and that will list where the dangerous goods are this is very common with freight aircraft so freight aircraft can have a thousand different manufactured goods on but then he may be taking radio isotopes for an x-ray machine now that's dangerous goods they have to be handled and they have to be packaged to a minimum requirement and there may be certain parts or the aircraft that is not allowed in and and so on so it's here the idea behind this is if an aircraft has to divert due to an emergency then the captain runs off the aircraft with the no-tock and he says to the fire chief yes I have radio isotopes on board and they're in that section of the aircraft that's what it's all about the yeah they will know they they will know plus the fact to take that a little further we found out that in Europe about two-thirds of the chemicals come from America and about a third of the chemicals come from India and there are various companies bringing them in the military we also believe are bringing them in as I said before I'm from Belgium and there's a base there Zootendal and they've been operating the military have been spraying for quite some time in fact the military have been spraying a lot longer than the civil operators civil operators have probably been in the last 20 years and they've upped it in the last four to five but the military before that the other pilots know what they're spraying

 not only the pilots then but presumably the rest of the the people involved the ground crew that would be loading the chemicals the manufacturers of the chemicals must have an inkling of where this stuff is going all the people associated with the the app and the military themselves they must surely be aware that they are breathing this stuff in in an everyday way you know not necessarily at work but but sitting in their garden on a day off going oh they're up above they must have an inkling that they are slowly poisoning themselves haven't they

 excellent question yes you would have thought that people would have worked that out by now the access to the well the whole system is very cleverly designed a lot of these freight companies particularly the dedicated ones who are just spraying us and not taking freight they have a very strict code standard operating procedures you'll find that a lot of these pilots are ex-military so they would have signed their company their country's official Secrets Act they know how to keep their mouths shut the engineers that work on these airplanes typically are ex-military again the same rule supply the supplies of the chemicals yeah their chemicals are used for whatever they probably don't ask too many questions the people that mix them yes they will know for sure but they'll be very few very then again they'll be under very strict contracts of the disclosure agreements and so on and yeah it's it's very well organized but the amount of people doing the handling will be minimum what they have what we have noticed is that the point of entry for a lot of these chemicals tend to be larger airfields because they're being pulled in by 747s or heavy military jets they are then distributed to smaller airfields you presumably by road and airfields I'm going to mention a couple of in the UK for instance Cardiff is a good one because the public really can't see anything of the airfield they've got some hangarage there where if any aircraft are between the hangars again the public can't see this so it's ideal for these operators to use these type of airfields where they can where they can't be seen

 and these people who are doing this and handling this you know on the lower sort of ranks presumably they also have wives and children that they must be aware they're also poisoning I mean it does seem crazy that these people but maybe these people have been selected that they don't have any family or don't give a monkeys about their family and their mothers and fathers and so on it despite the fact that is it may be a small number

 yeah it's a bit of a mixture Richard I mean I fly business jets so I've been to many many different airfields in the UK and all around Europe and talking to a lot of the ground handling agents some of whom obviously will deal with these chemicals the amount of people that are allowed to deal with them will be absolutely minimal they have been told not to ask questions and just to get on with their job and the usual threat is that they would be sacked if they do get involved or they want to ask too many questions that that's standard seems to be standard but I what has shocked me is the amount of people that are working at the airports that just don't seem to be aware of their environment and typically I saw a very unusual aircraft which was out of base it was a Delta aircraft and it was at Manchester Airport now Delta I know do not fly into Manchester and it was an Airbus A330 and I know for well as many people do that there is a an Airbus going around with the Delta livery and it's got Delta written underneath it and with an American registration we don't believe it's actually being operated by Delta but it was at Manchester and it was out of place they don't fly there and of course the excuse is given that oh yes it was a medical emergency and it was a diversion the long-haul diversion so the crew in the hotel people need to learn to question things and one of the things that I know well we know many people who are now starting to inquire about this it's difficult because the intelligence that we need is people who work at airports air traffic controllers we need them to speak up we know that their jobs have been threatened I've spoken to one or two air traffic controllers and they've said yeah we can't talk about certain things and they won't because they're so scared of losing their jobs but we do need more registrations we do need them to start speaking up the amount of people as I said before who deal with these particular packages these chemicals are absolutely minimum I think they just blindly do their job which is very sad but yes you're right they're breathing them in

 how can the public if they wanted to get in to gather evidence help gather that evidence if they went to airports would they see could they if they had certain knowledge what would they need to know I mean you mentioned about Delta and it went through my mind of course the idea of these medical emergencies what with people dropping down dead every 10 minutes thanks to a certain medical intervention that we've all been dropped we can see how that and the advent of a potential bird flu or these sort of other narratives that are being thrust at us could disguise the airplanes roots and delivery patterns but could if is there information that the public can can do relatively easily to



 expose or gather the evidence so that this can be highlighted later on

 yes there's a lot of things they can do so number one now you know about it please be more attentive we know that the aircraft that are physically spraying over the land are between 10 and 15,000 feet they tend to fly quite slowly and they're not on your flight radar apps so if you have anybody with a good camera or a good good camera phone or indeed a telephoto lens somebody who's a photographer photographs of these aircraft with location time date distance sorry not distance the direction that they're flying when they go to the airports anything unusual unusual equipment and for instance some of these freighters are out of place the key thing is somebody must know somebody who works at an airport that's really key and what we're going to do is you're just asking anybody that works at an airport it's your next-door neighbor it's your friend down the road ask them now there's a little trick that they can do as I said don't tell me just write it down so if they get a registration of an aircraft or something like this this is just to be more attentive the other thing we would say is oversee over the sea they're spraying the sea as well we know this they tend to drop down to around about 5,000 feet and we've noticed various places particularly the Pacific Ocean you can actually see the chemtrails with some of the live satellite feeds that you can get we also know that they've been spraying the stretch of water between I think it's Cornwall and Devon I think it is and the South Wales coast at 5,000 feet so fishing and farmers everybody yes just pay more attention photographs and there's plenty of websites out there now that you can actually post these on



 one of the things I suggested and I've yet to compile it because haven't really got enough good ones to put on the show unfortunately because it all takes a bit of time would be time-lapse photography getting a camera setting it up and then over a period of hours or even an hour or so show how the the airplanes have come into the sky and then watch the formation of the clouds to prove exactly what's happening if lots of people were doing that and posting those images so that more people could see the the impact of that would that help

 yes it would greatly particularly if there's a time stamp on the on the video yes absolutely

 let's go back to Russ one of the things that has been given to me as a as a alternative solution or suggestion rather is that what we're seeing is the the amount of pollution over the last what should we say 80 90 hundred years since planes have been flying that it's actually the fact that it's that whatever the the airplane fuel is diesel petrol whatever it is and it's the accumulation of that up in the atmosphere is that is that even possible or is that complete nonsense well

 it is possible but what we've got to realize Richard and everybody's got to realize since COVID and the way everybody was let's face it dupes in many many ways and to this day is they're still trying project fear the ramping up of the geo engineering has surpassed anything else that's been done yes that's a percentage of what's in the sky is genuine contrails but now I would say it's definitely more like 96 97 maybe even 98 percent of the lines you're seeing in the sky is this poison you know and just to go back to what we were saying previously the brilliant dane wigginson on geoengineering watch org he has a youtube channel and he does a weekly update normally comes through to I think the UK gets it on a Sunday and he does an hour long update of news from around the world regarding geo engineering that of course the mainstream aren't reporting on now if we go back to the recent Dubai cloud seeding fiasco that was nothing new to people like us that know because in fact they over cooked that and that's what created them disastrous floods that everybody knew it was so bad that mainstream couldn't avoid reporting it that was actually done again it was actually done previous to that in November of last year and there are there is a video that's available on YouTube if you used to type in Dubai floods November of the desert under six foot or so with camels trying to actually have the swim to survive what they're doing they're also like they did with coving in a particular way they're saying to people it's not what you're seeing you're not seeing it don't believe your own eyes which causes a quote from 1984 George Orwell now that their final command is you know you do not believe your own eyes or ears well we can all see what's going on and with the cloud seeding what they're now trying to do is to make everybody think that it's just cloud seeding and not poison we have to stress it is a poison yes cloud seeding is part of geoengineering but that's normally achieved with just a twin engine propeller driven aircraft which fires some silver into the clouds to make it rain or stop it rain when you get it wrong you get what happened in Dubai but the problem here is the poison as we've mentioned for example the aluminium when it gets into the soil it kills all plant life from the roots up yes it's been proven again if we quote geoengineering to all ten years ago it was already being seen that bee populations were suffering and it's even been reported to us here in the UK now that these are being witnessed flying around plants in people's gardens and people are saying well that's behaving oddly and the bees have been proven to have so much aluminium building up in a system but then they've got to get in a form of Alzheimer's disease and they're not even flying around naturally anymore yes dying off in thousands and of course if the bees die and the crops die which is part of the plan and the overall agenda that's where you're getting your food supply problems from that's

 the great famine

 yeah this is how it's all connected Richard

 the MPs say and people have sent me freedom of information requests or they've they've been in touch with their MPs and said you know we know what's going on the MPs keep saying no this is part of the if it's happening at all they'll come out with the same story that it is to dim the sky to radiate to save the planet and all of that which may well you know as we've discussed is part of the story or is the cover story literally a cover story however none of us have been asked to have our consent to this they've just done it anyway surely there ought to be in the manifesto particularly now with the the next election do you think it would be and I did make a video on this that the MPs should be asked if they are going to be doing this and continuing to do this if they want our vote and if they are going to do it perhaps we should be saying well I'm not going to vote for you because I've not consented to have anything sprayed in the sky no matter what it is it's going to come down at some point and we're going to breathe it in do you think blitzing MPs and potential MPs and all these candidates getting in is a sensible suggestion to get them to promise to campaign against it or to say the people don't want it

 I think if I can jump in here I think that's an excellent idea it I know that the people have actually been serving notices on their MPs along those lines the MPs are just like to establish these it's the same pretty much for the UK and around Europe standard letter comes back and the MPs will not will not go back to the foundations which is the Paris climate accord in 2015 which all member states signed an agreement saying that this is what they would go ahead and do undertake the geoengineering none of us none of us had a say in that but the MP will find some comfort under the false legitimacy of this parish climate accord now the parish climate accord is totally based on fraud you won't get the MPs to go beyond that they'll say no everything we're doing is in accordance with in accordance with so the fact is we know that it's based on for because we know the co2 levels they've lied about it we know all that



 to go to your MP and say where what would you do what is your take on this that is a very very searching question and I think when MPs realize now that if they are in any way going to support this they're not going to get a vote they have a choice they either genuinely change their minds about something and campaign actively against it and I think you'll find a lot of MPs won't because I think a lot of them we found that have been either I've got to say this carefully there's been inducements and they're paid for however that inducement has been that they're paid for so that effectively will be the end of their career so they're actually driving themselves into a hard corner and it's organic but people should be asking their own piece that precise question yes

 I mean presumably once they've been put on notice and they've been told this is what's going on and here is the the evidence as we can present it if they are complicit with that that is the complicit that they are then complicit to effectively and I don't like to say this but murder

 accessory after the fact yes and the I think a lot of people including myself gave our local MPs the benefit of the doubt I certainly did about five years ago and that's called if they were trying to do something and it's gone wrong but it was done in innocence that's misfeasance this is the blacks law dictionary now malfeasance is when they know they're doing something wrong or they can go they've been told they've been doing something wrong with evidence and they continue to do it it's now willful it's malicious that's malfeasance in public office that's a very serious offense and those people who are in the cabinets of our various governments that is treason and that's where international law and the law of war manual comes in and it doesn't matter what agreements these companies have got with the government saying that they cannot be sued or they cannot be pursued they are invalid because everything is based on fraud and there are ongoing military tribunals and it's only a matter of time I believe before that they will catch up with these people but in the meantime yes we serve notice with evidence on to every MP every MP in every country

 so certainly my viewers who are on the whole quite active and quite keen to get involved in this sort of thing in terms of writing to MPs or to anybody else even the even the companies that are doing this to show their disapproval or to show their anger in an honourable way on paper to say we know what you're doing and we're putting you on notice that they they could certainly get their pens warmed up as it were to get in touch and show the evidence and you've pointed to Dane Wiginton site at geoengineeringwatch.org which as a good site we I know again I'm referencing Ian Simpson because I've had him on the show fairly recently I've also had Dane on the show a couple of times Ian's take was that we would have to have a some form of legal case to make this into a precedent I'm not 100% clear how you would do that but do you think that is a way of stopping this that nobody actually wants or nobody's asked for or is there a better way

 that that is a way it is an option for us the only issues that we have discussed this at length and by the way I just want to say at this point that we're not lone soldiers fortunately there are more and more people waking up in the aviation industry I know personally now four or five six pilots in the UK that are very active I know about 15 in Germany that are very active I know five in Belgium that are active so there are more and more people now getting aware of this to answer the question the legal system as it stands at the moment is incredibly corrupt for the reasons that we know and we mentioned before to get a case to mount a case will be fairly costly it will be rigorously defended by lawyers who are on the wrong side of the fence and judges that are on the wrong side of the fence and that would be very consuming as far as the cost is concerned and also very consuming time-wise and I would suggest it's time that that we don't have so the we still continue down that road yes I think it's merit worthy the other thing is to record everything and there are two ways you can do this to send to the ICC the International Court of the Hague and also there is the Inspector General of the US Air Force and if you go online and look up Inspector General US Air Force you will find a section there to report corrupt persons and you can register your details so that's with the US Air Force Inspector General the reason why I mentioned this is because there are ongoing military tribunals and they are all over they're not just Guantanamo Bay they're in Diego Garcia they're on several aircraft carriers and so on



 they are going through a very long list of indictments that have been ongoing since I believe 2019 once they they've almost gone through all of them and they are estimating eight and a half million further indictments for shall we say middle and lower management and this will be everybody that has been proven to be conducting operations which are considered crimes against humanity and



 chemical spraying of people is crimes against humanity there are two ways about it and we see this daily every time we get airborne almost every day we see them in the sky and I have a trick where I switch off my air conditioning you have to do it very carefully because the pressure on the ears but I will not have any of the air conditioning working as we're flying through the levels where these chemtrails are in and as I say they're generally between 10 and 15,000 feet

 What does it look like just as a matter of interest I haven't been in an aeroplane for some time what does it look like when you're flying above these trails being laid we we see them from the ground and they look like lines of do they have height these things as the various weight of the the particulates drop to make it into more like a vertical ribbon



 yeah so as you get different perspectives as you're taking off or as you're coming into life and so taking off yes you you can see that you normally burst through a cloud layer and yes there they are so I do my best to avoid them and if we've been given a heading to steer then it's going to take me right through one I will ask air traffic if I have the time to 10 degrees left 10 degrees right to avoid they normally grant me this unless you're in busy airspace like Frankfurt and the standard instrument departure is the departure because there's so many other airplanes around so you can't always avoid them from above you get a better perspective providing there's no intermediate cloud layers and yes you can see the extensive way they're flying them you can't see them you can't see the particulates because a lot of them are nano as well as micro but you can see where previous ones were and how they've spread out certainly here but you get a better perspective when you're above them

 I assume that somewhere online there are photographs from above to show it and that sort of thing would be quite useful I suppose if anybody's going on holiday or in in an aircraft and can take pictures of like that just to give us a different perspective because I think when you're on the ground they can seem perhaps to the ordinary layman innocuous but once you know what they are and I'm just looking at that picture that's next to me at this very moment I mean the amount of stuff that's in the sky there and you know then it's all these heavy metals which should not be anywhere near our lungs and in our bodies it's it's incredibly scary but to the to the layman who is unsure about all of this it they're still thinking oh it's just you know it's just that's contrails gone mad or something but from above it do you get a feeling that they're bigger thicker deeper more complex

 yes yeah they're very intensive not nine times out of ten they're very intensive they're also depending on the aircraft and the fix that they have the method by which they can spray these chemicals you can actually determine I think there's an operator using a seven to seven and that's got a big boom at the back that's very distinctive because that leaves a very wide stripe so yeah it's um I don't know what else to say about it we can spot them a mile off it's a good idea for any holidaymakers if they see them yes that's our video the window that you're sitting next to tends to be very limited on your angle I've taken videos from the cockpit now and of aircraft below chem trailing and they have been posted online

 what do you think we were sort of running out of time now what do you think the outcome is to prevent this and to stop it and how long do you think we have before the effects of this have really ramped up so much I mean so difficult now to tell what's making people ill because we live in so much poison with the EMFs of our business world and the home world with 5g or the normal 4g and all of that going on a certain chemical that's been injected into people because they were frightened of a certain virus and now water pollution that we know is happening and the skies I mean everything is against us but do you think that and we've seen this this particular that from the winter till this point it still feels like winter because the temperature drops as soon as they those clouds come over by several degrees which is extremely noticeable there's no warmth in the atmosphere that you would normally get which does seem to be characteristic of it is there a positive outcome either of Russ or Eve

 I'll let Russ answer that one first



 definitely a positive outcome if we can all get together to save humanity by just looking up at the sky taking the pictures taking the video that we've already discussed making people aware that what they were growing in what I used to see in the sky when they were younger is no longer there where's your blue sky where's your sunshine why does it sometimes when it's cloudy when you go outside it smells you can smell the atmosphere you know some it's not right get people to look up



 question things the more we get people that are awake and spread this knowledge then we can defeat it I can't give you a time scale but we will prevail I promise you that

 yeah I'd like to add to that I totally agree with what Russ is saying and let's not forget we have been enslaved definitely been enslaved with everything taxes and everything and the whole system is changing just on a bit of a spiritual side we've we have God-given rights and no man has any right to take those rights away no one so we it needs to be it will be defeated it will be defeated and the earth and nature does have a wonderful way of recovery it's it's historically that's always been the case so we do need everybody to be vigilant put in what you can Facebook is being actually exploded with people's posts and so on that equally sadly there are these shields out there that are obviously hired guns to spread disinformation they're very clever the way they can do it it can be very subtle and they're just there to make you angry and hopefully dissuade you from continuing no we need to march through this and so we need any bits of information never think that any information that you have might be too small for anybody because it's nine times out of ten it's the missing piece that we need

 on a final note I've got to ask you because people have been talking about this for a long time now or it seems the last few weeks and it's become a bit trendy and a bit a bit I don't know left of field organic white vinegar the fumes of that does that make any blind bit of difference or is that just hope in

 I've not tested it so I can't really answer that one I'm afraid of you

 have you tried it Russ

 no not at all I've obviously seen the posts and had conversations but we've got no evidence that there's anything in it but why not try it if it makes you feel better and if you get the proof it works then great shout about it from the rooftops

 absolutely if anything you know do give it a whirl listen gentlemen it's been an absolute joy and very very fascinating for me and the listeners watching today thank you so much for your time and raising your heads above the parapet albeit somewhat disguised as best we can please continue to do what you're doing and reporting and getting the message out and of course we will do our best on this channel to continue to talk about this subject which is as you say it's growing I mean people are beginning to look up and they're beginning to take notice and the next government in this country at the election on the 4th of July maybe should be thinking very closely if they want to keep their seats or stay in government particularly as you were saying about the military trials whether they want to even stay free people about they should be concerning themselves with one of these biggest issues and that is the poisoning of the skies and the air that we breathe as well as the food that we eat so I just want to say a big thank you for coming on and very much appreciate it



 I just encourage all your listeners just to continue what you're doing and just do your own research

 absolutely

 thanks for it lashing day you're it's it and we will prevail

 thank you so much well there we are that's Eve's and Russ pilots they're telling us what they know and and how they've been watching this over the last X many years 10 years or more and it's now up to us to continue their work by doing the best we can making this as obvious as possible so that there is no option but to stop I'll be back with more monologues and more wonderful guests but in the meantime thank you for watching till next time from us all goodbye
