 Hello and welcome back to the channel thank you for joining me in another of my wonderful interviews. Now fairly recently you will know the weather has been atrocious we've had flat grey skies for ages all through the winter and it does seem to me that there is reason behind that that it's been manufactured that way and many times last year since I've been running these videos I've made videos in which I've said to people look at the sky isn't it strange all these sort of strange marks the noughts and crosses or at least the grid pattern for noughts and crosses going across there and we've had people like Dane Wigginton from America on and we've had other people speculate and talk about these things in the sky. Now apparently I've been told we mustn't use the C word and not the the word that makes you ill that one but the the word about the trails that are blazoned across the sky. So today I'm very thrilled to have a climate engineering activist and campaigner who's been researching this for many years. His name's Ian Simpson and he joins me now. Ian welcome to the show it's lovely to have you here.

 Richard hello and yeah very glad to be here thanks for having me on.

 Now as I say you're you're an activist you're a campaigner you've been researching this for a long time and you know a lot about you we had a little bit of a preamble before we started to record which was great put me in my place about using the word chemtrails which is a sort of slang term and you did say something which I think was really important to get out and other people have mentioned this to me and I've sort of not paid as much attention and that is by getting the terminology correct people take you a little bit more seriously. Could you just sort of again tell me what you told me a few moments?

 Yeah and it's something I became aware of after about a year to 18 months of being involved in this topic which was you know I came to see that as soon as you say the C word it's almost like a trigger word people change you know and I don't really understand what's going on some kind of mind programming who knows



 but I noticed that people would almost like switch off either that or they would try suddenly become quite combative and try to denigrate you or dismiss the topic and you know even though they've never heard of it or never thought about it and never done any research they seem to have these pre-prepared statements about why it's utter nonsense and you don't know what you're talking about and stuff like that which in itself makes no sense but I guess my point really is that if you so I used term climate engineering I know in America they use geoengineering both equally as valid but climate engineering is the official scientific term and it has a dictionary definition the large-scale manipulation of weather systems or something like that you could look it up I can't remember exactly word for word but that's pretty much what it's defined as if you stick to the scientific terms nobody can attack you for being a conspiracy theorist or you know a nutter or paranoid tin foil hat you know all the usual nonsense terms that are grown at people such as myself and yourself and anyone else who tries to raise awareness about this and also it kind of elevates you to some extent to a more intellectual level because you're using the terminology that the scientists are using you know yes yeah I think it's the best way forward

 brilliant I will try to I will try to remember to do that a lot more often and and I think that's worth doing across the board so shall we let's just start at the beginning because there's going to be members of the audience who will know what we're talking about and then there'll be other people who are perhaps on borderline they perhaps have got an idea so let me first of all I mentioned that the winter seems to have been unusually cloudy and and it does seem as if rain has been the main theme and cold winds is that a manufactured state is that is that something that that they are doing or is that could that just be you know fluke of the weather for this particular time of year

 no no no absolutely pretty much all weather is now manufactured and you know I do accept that we you know we use the term they because people like you know your audience and myself and others who are aware of all these things we understand what that means you know and again some people who attack it but you know I think it's a valid term all weather is manufactured now 100% on a daily basis all over the world very few clouds you see in the sky are natural possibly none at all you know I haven't seen a truly clear natural sky for years now years and years and years it's a global phenomena anywhere there are commercial air class flying there is weather manipulation and even on the days and here's the thing that most people won't understand even those who are aware of this topic is even the days that we're allowed what we perceive to be a sunny day the air is full of stuff let's just say stuff as a kind of you know enveloping term that there's been sprayed I guess probably the next stage is to explain what they're doing in terms of the different programs so so far over I started let me jump back slightly I started doing this in 2013 I became aware of it I noticed it in the sky one day and I was like oh my god what what on earth is that and so anyway ten years later I've got a pretty extensive and knowledge of of exactly what's going on and you can narrow it down to three essential programs so one is the black trails now the black trails as far as I'm aware is they're pumping diesel into the exhaust plume of the engine a few years back there were people saying it was additives in the fuel you know there may be additives in the fuel I don't know I've got no way of testing but that's not what's causing what we see there's the black trail so as far as I'm aware do you know what pylon pipes are so the pylon on an aircraft is the the the section between the wing and the engine so you have the wing and you have the engine underneath so there's that kind of what's the word trapezoidal is it the shape anyway there are three if you look at all aircrafts there are three all Airbus aircraft have three pipes like that two long ones and one short one burning planes have one single pipe now these are retrofitted systems and they pump chemicals into the atmosphere so going back to the original point and the black trails what they're doing they're using these pipes and as far as I'm aware they're pumping diesel into the engine it combusts or they're pumping what's called carbon black some form of carbon compound it could be buckyballs it could be something else I don't know c60 stuff like that or there was something that they people researchers like into Columna discovered in in the vaccines which was right in the the things I shouldn't say that word you can bleep that out

 it's all right now I mean you can still say I think we're we're pretty safe now but unless we go on about yeah

 which was graphene hydroxide or graphene oxide some people call it graphene oxide it's actually graphene hydroxide but anyway again it's some form of carbon type molecule so it could be that we don't know but anyway what this does is it causes huge plumes of black smoke and there's a there's a great video I did on in 2014 which is on youtube and the sorry which is on vimeo and the link is vimeo.com 8808



 0046 and it's called smokers and you can clearly see a fleet of planes flying around in patterns none of them were on flight radar so they're not broadcasting any adsb information adsb is the flight information so the altitude the speed etc none of them are broadcasting and they're flying backwards and forwards they're turning around right under the plane and you can see this huge plumes of black smoke coming out the back now this was an absolute game changer because nobody can say that that is a natural phenomenon all right a jet engine cannot under any circumstances normal circumstances produce a black trail unless it's on fire now right clearly a plane with four engines on fire isn't going to stay up for very long and these things are going around in circles like that pumping thick black smoke so that's program number one uh let me just address the why uh the why is possibly two things one it could be causing very large amounts of co2 so they're forcing the whole co2 argument two pollution now when you when you go to Cornwall and you have a visibility of 10 miles and you see a hill in the distance and you can't you can barely see it because there's a smog you know that's not normal pollution there's no industry in Cornwall there are no factories there yes no quite nobody has coal fires anymore cars are very very clean these days you know and there's not that much traffic in Cornwall so i phoned the met office and i said what's all this pollution they said um sorry i've gone off on a tangent but it's quite important this they said oh it's pollution i said where's the pollution come from and they said oh it must have drifted down from London so i said well hang on the wind speed is two to four miles an hour how did it get from London rush hour which starts at 7am and it's now 10am to Cornwall oh uh it must be coming from somewhere else then and then they hung up so you see my point yes absolutely they're just making this stuff up so anyway going back to the point so it could be for two reasons one to encourage the whole pollution thing which Steak Calm is is is using to tax people into oblivion uh something we can touch on again later on um let's move on to the second one so the second one is probably is is the one that everybody recognizes and everybody sees every day which is you know the crisscross lines and the the what what are termed officially by the Met Office as persistent contrails now the first thing to point out is there is no such thing as a persistent contrail even you know natural contrails are actually extremely rare and the official figures prior to me starting to investigate this were minus 57 degrees which only tends to happen really at 37 000 feet plus or above those were official figures by the Met Office until i questioned them and quoted them and then they changed them but anyway um so there's no such thing as a persistent contrail even a natural contrail which as i said is quite rare very high you can't like if a plane is at 37 000 feet you can't see it you can see the trail okay so what they do now is they're sorry i'm digressing you can no no they they broadcast false altitude data to and then and you see a plane and if you can see the tail livery and you can see the windows that's not 37 000 feet it's 16 to 20 max if you can hear a plane it's under 20 000 feet okay and this is basic common sense and trigonometry and basic science you know you don't have to be a genius to work this out so anyway persistent trails so um apart from the fact they vary from plane to plane all modern jet engines use the same technology now they're all high high bypass turbofan engines so none of them should be leaving anything but you see different trails from different planes some are slightly shorter some are very heavy and they've spread out very quickly some are slower and what they're doing is these these trails they either so there are three pipes so it's combination therapy there are at least two if not three different chemicals they're spraying and what they do is they mix in the air and depending on the mix which they can alter um they produce a very uh thick and defined trail or that or they can dilute it slightly you know either way they they can control exactly how that trail behaves and how thick it is but on on a really bad day you'll see a great big stripe in the sky and that stripe will slowly spread out and this is what people are seeing more and more and more and they're trying to hide it but they can't um more and more and more and so eventually there's another one and then another one and then another one and then they all kind of merge together and you get what's called a white out so the entire sky is basically white

 and we that's what we've been seeing very very frequently yeah

 now um there is a way of kind of disguising this to some extent and that brings us on to the third program so the third program are what i call induced cumulus it's a it's a term i coined basically induced obviously because they're false they're fake they're creative and cumulus because they look a bit like cumulus clouds because they're sort of fluffy and you know kind of slightly cloud-shaped um again they're not real now now the way they produce these is they spray these tiny tiny tiny little plastic fibers micro fibers into the air now what happens with these things is um all the phone masts around the country have uh some antenna on the top okay and this is a dedicated system which is run by the met i believe i have to say i believe because i don't have direct proof of this but everything i've worked at over the last 10 years has led me to believe this so it is to some extent speculative but i'm pretty 100 on this the met office have some kind of mainframe computer that controls this antenna system okay and i'll get onto why in just a second so it charges the atmosphere ionizes the atmosphere as the atmosphere it becomes ionized all these little plastic fibers form these little fluffy clouds okay and this is what the way i discovered this the first clue to this was i was at the coast and i knew that these clouds are fake okay but one day i i thought oh hang on a minute they seem to be appearing at the coastline



 and then on another occasion soon after that i noticed they were disappearing at the coastline so of course you'd have a great big bank of cloud and here's the coastline and they come along and it would just they just disappear so prior to all these offshore wind farms and i'll expand on that in a sec you never ever ever saw these clouds oversee mmm assistant trails are independent of anything else you would think so yes they're sprayed they form cloud and they sit there yeah they don't rely on any other technology whereas the the induced cumulus rely on what i believe is a is a system of ionizing antenna across the country and here's the other thing so when you go to the nasa world view website so this is a weather monitoring satellite now unfortunately it only passes over once a day so you only get a snapshot and it changes each day so sometimes it can be 5 a.m 10 a.m 4 p.m blah blah blah but you get a pretty good idea of what's going on um on a daily basis and it's it's an invaluable resource um what you see is that these clouds form in rows across the country either up and down or like that or you know any particular direction now um i thought okay i've got them so what i'm going to do is i'm going to plot all the locations of all these antenna and i bet you they will match the lines so i found a website that has all these antenna but guess what they've done you know if you use google google maps as a foundation technology for um a mapping system you can zoom in and out can't you yes so you get lots of lots of points of reference and then you zoom in and you see more of them blah blah blah but on this particular map although they're using google as far as i'm aware you can't see more than one at a time no matter what you do and the reason they've done that is i believe again speculation is to hide the pattern because if we if we if we match the pattern of the clouds to the pattern of the antenna that's a pretty clear sign that you know they're linked so we can't prove that as yet however i'm absolutely again pretty convinced that that's what's going on um but there's some great videos on my website on my vimeo channel



 which shows these clouds forming and you can see this go to the coast make sure there's no offshore wind farm near you because that's how that's how they've managed to extend this cloud formation into the sea off the coastline

 right okay so i am on the coast and we do have the rampian wind farm so i'm buggered uh okay so it would go so what you're saying is that the the wind farm the offshore wind farm would have antennas on them which means that they can extend these 100 right and and i but but beyond that so in other words if you were in a fishing boat and you managed to get past the rampian or whatever the offshore wind farm is it doesn't have to be a fishing boat by the way you could be any kind of boat but as long as you kept beyond that you could see this sort of strange line forming that effectively the

 if you're not in range of land and i i believe the range of these antenna is a few miles no more than a few miles because they're spaced every few miles yes and the Brighton were so i'm in hove basically so we've got the Brighton wind farm um and uh it's eight miles offshore so i would imagine that the the range of the antenna is probably about four miles yeah it's five miles which kind of makes sense because that's kind of how often these antenna masts are spread yes and i think they did that once i once i start the publishing videos of these things disappearing at the coast so if the wind is blowing towards the sea obviously the clouds disappear and you can see it if you time lapse the greatest weapon you have is a time lapse camera it really is i've got some of the most mind-blowing videos with with time lapse cameras and it's a tlc 200 i can't remember what what the make is now but if you talk in two tlc 200 time lapse camera they're reasonably cheap and



 this is the thing nobody has the time apart from myself and other people as dedicated as myself to sit there and watch the sky for hours on end because you know we're all busy and we're all spread and

 bro but i can see the point a time lapse camera i mean i'm in i'm surprised we haven't argue

 with that okay you see it happening and you see the patterns and it's it's absolutely mine and you catch all sorts of stuff going on um so that is a third program and the third one is possibly the most disturbing um because and we we we we go right down a rabbit hole here so um i'm doing uh a talk on um uh at the uh av14 as you know and the talk is called the invisible sky and nobody the the reason they're getting away with this and the reason most people don't care is because they can't see it now everyone has a slightly different lifestyle okay but there are certain things that that people are doing more and more and more of that interfere with the mechanisms by which they hide this thing so these tiny little plastic fibers okay they collect on your tongue they have nanotechnology in them and they form into these structures now somehow these structures are interacting with us okay whether it's through the nervous the vascular system or connecting directly to the brain i don't really know i'm not a neuroscientist i don't have a biotech laboratory um i did try and do some research on this at my university before they threw me out um and i didn't get any conclusive answers but i'm pretty convinced that that's really what's going on because when you when you remove this stuff from your throat and you can see they've been great big blobs and you gargle with red wine and there are videos online about this it's called the red wine test um i have a really good one where i just get loads and loads of this stuff out so when you remove all this nanotech from your throat two things happen one you can see the sky for what it really is okay you can see all the trails you can see the plains you can see what's really going on before that you can't now that is that

 is incredible so what did you just go through that again you just gargle with red wine

 and you have to get a robust red wine quite a good red wine preferably organic because organic contains all the natural things in it most of the wine you buy in supermarkets is what you might call denatured it has goodness taken out and possibly nasty stuff put in but it doesn't it works to some extent but it's not as good so if you get a robust organic red wine gargle um and the first time you do it you have to do it for quite a while after that it happens quicker but all this stuff comes off the back of your tongue it's at the back of your tongue as your tongue goes down there it's all there so you can gargle it and you suddenly you you notice all these blobs in your throat and you spit them out um spit them onto you know like blotting paper thick art paper



 okay and what it will do it will dry onto the paper and then you can look at it even with the naked eye you can see there is a structure to this thing i call it it's like a biosynthetic organism



 there's a kind of a main branch uh sorry i'm kind of drawing on my hand which you can't see but i do have these somewhere but i don't i don't have them ready to show here no no that's okay uh but it looks like you you know there's pictures we used to see of in the biology books at school and it would have the nervous system and then it would have the vascular system right what it looks at it looks like the vascular system so there's a main branch there's all the ones coming off and then there's all the little um i can't remember what they're called now all the vascicles or a current capillary yeah i mean off capillaries and it's like a bloody organism right literally bloody sorry yeah yeah literally because you've used red wine so what's happening here is um because that whatever you whatever the color of the thing that you've used and you can use uh certain fruit juices as well apple juice is really good plum juice is really good now quite what it is in these liquids that is making these things release i don't know i don't know and and if you flip that round i also can't work out exactly what is making them form because so what i did is i gathered so house okay so house dust think of house dust we're told it's 95 skin no it's not okay it might be five skin it might be five dust most of it is tiny plastic fibers okay so get a piece of glass



 you know so big a foot by foot or large or whatever get a razor blade leave the glass out for three or four days and it will have loads of this stuff on it scoop it all up with a razor blade put it into a little blob and look at it under the microscope and you will see it's tiny plastic fibers thousands and thousands and thousands of them and that's what you know when you see these hazy skies that's what that's what you're seeing is you're looking through trillions and trillions of these things now as we breathe in they settle on the tongue somehow something in the mouth is making them form now again it requires electromagnetism so your phone the phone masts bluetooth wi-fi all these things so it it needs electromagnetism emf yes to work but here's the thing so i collected these things and i put them into a lump and i put saliva all over them and i had my phone there nothing happened okay so how is it forming in the mouth and not forming out of the mouth so there must be some kind of protein or salivary amylase or some other reagent in the mouth that allows these things to form so it needs and this is why they're so keen for us all to have wi-fi everywhere because that's what these things rely on now right going even deeper into this whether the it's quite possible that the wi-fi is programming these organisms in some way or receiving or transmitting or something like that i i don't know again this this is real quite deep speculation so i'm not really sure but somehow these structures or biosynthetic organisms are interacting with us okay now going back to my original point which was people can't see the sky until they remove these things so these things are preventing us seeing everything that's happening

 so i'd say that that is absolutely fascinating so i was gonna i was gonna ask one of the questions was you know they're spraying it with all these different things we'll get into the purpose and all of those other questions but what always struck me is presumably it's coming down what goes up must come down unless that's a lie but whatever it is we are ingesting so the question is is part of this to block the sun and is part of that for us to ingest it and surely those that perpetrate this are also ingesting it unless they have some capsule that they live in where they don't



 uh okay all of the above

 great so i'm glad we've solved that um

 the so there are there are several primary goals of climate engineering one is to block the sun okay on the grounds they will one day say oh we had to do it to protect you against global warming which we all know is utter rubbish

 yes and that is that i mean that is the excuse that we're hearing is that they're dimming this guy and and yet they're putting up i

 mean i'm saying this as you know as far back as late 2013 that you know they will they will use that as the excuse for having done it it's you know there's a corporate manager isn't it it's easier to say sorry than it is to ask permission um you know and that you know that's kind of their modus operandi really um where was i going off sorry repeat the quote oh yeah sorry yeah um okay so the fundamental really if it sunshine is incredibly important there's so many ways so many ways uh mood um vitamin d so i was banned from twitter now called x um for stating that vitamin d is fun is fundamental to supporting our immune system against viruses it allows us to fight against viruses and what happened



 we had a firing outbreak or so we were told but anyway go there um so sunshine is fundamental to our health mental health and physical health okay so that's one aspect if you block the sunshine you make people miserable and you make them unhealthy okay

 can i i'm just going to interrupt you there only because only because you mentioned about viruses and airborne things and on all of that and yet isn't it funny that in march 2020 when people were trapped in their houses by a government diktat that the skies were clear and if if as you say vitamin d is so important to get rid of viruses yet we were told there was a virus and yet we had copious amounts of more sun than you could shake a stick at it was certainly down here on the south coast but everywhere it seemed the skies were clear so either the pilots were also locked down or which i don't think they probably had to worry about um or that was just telling us that they were telling us lies about certain medical things

 uh i mean that's a huge tangent which we probably haven't got time to go on i mean the whole thing was a scam the whole covid thing was a scam of course you know any anyone with a reasonably well-functioning brain should have worked that out by now um just just as a side point i was monitoring aviation out of heathrow um during the whole kind of lockdown thing and there was still a hundred flights plus a day going in and out of the heathrow okay okay and were they empty who knows you know apparently nobody was flying but here's the thing they have to keep the planes flying because if they don't the sky will clear yes okay

 and then we see this then we see it for what it

 is actually i'm just gonna write a note here pricing okay that's something i i want to talk about as well but um not now so what are the other reasons so the other reasons are to poison us with assorted toxins and chemicals now um here's an interesting story which happened to me in oh blimey it must have been late 2013 uh i was on a flight



 and um i was on my own i think it was come back from italy and suddenly the cabin got really hot and i got really tired and i fell asleep and i noticed everyone else when i when i started coming around i noticed that everyone else was also asleep now i thought that's really odd and it took me the best part best part of three years to kind of mulch this through in my head and i suddenly realized what had happened so have you heard of something called aero toxic syndrome

 um i have but i don't know much about it

 so aero toxic syndrome is uh the term given to cover up harm produced by trails inside an aircraft inside the the fuselage so if you're traveling on a plane so imagine a plane passes behind another plane it goes through the exhaust plumes yes okay now all but one airliner have air coming into the cabin or the fuselage let's call it yeah um so you're breathing in the air from outside okay so if you go through a trail you're breathing in you're taking in the air from that trail okay now people have been left with neurological disorders semi-paralyzed all sorts of really serious health problems fortunately for me when it happened to me or the the event that i was involved in i didn't have any lasting effect i fell asleep



 or i don't know how long but the whole plane just suddenly fell asleep god knows what happened to the pilots no

 i was just gonna say presumably the pilots uh had the same

 well i mean they have autopilot don't they i i really don't know i wasn't in the cockpit i have no way of knowing that and to be honest i didn't at the time i didn't know what was going on anyway so i didn't even think about that um but here's the thing so what does this suggest so one aero toxic syndrome is uh an indication that toxins are contained within the trails so there are all sorts of you know hydrocarbons that could be doing horrible things to us but the fact that every a whole plane load of people fell asleep at the same time oh i've got a warning saying your internet connection is unstable so let's hope that that doesn't go um the fact the whole plane fell asleep at the same time would suggest sedatives so that could be another thing that they're spraying now again can i prove that no i can't but you know all these things i came up with it um in just sorry another little tangent um i came up a few years back with a thing called conjectural focal point so it's often argued oh that's just one example you can't prove that that happened you know you can't prove that that's that so if you draw a circle and you draw a line that pointing into the circle from a direction that's just one line it doesn't mean anything you could say well that's coincidence okay if you have loads and loads and loads and loads of lines all pointing towards that center collectively they suggest that something's going on and that's really kind of how this topic works when you get really deep into all the different aspects of it um individually it could be argued that you know that could be coincidence you could be wrong you know this that and the other but ultimately when you when you look at the picture collectively all these things point to the same thing that they're poisoning us and they block the sun so we have blocking the sunshine vitamin d possible toxins um you mentioned the fact that you know how do they protect themselves now um okay so again i don't know all the things that they're spraying even after my 10 years because it's very difficult you know and let you get up there with a canister and then take it to a laboratory and spend loads of money and time and stuff i haven't had the time and the funds to do that um i have i'm pretty sure that they're spraying barium okay barium is touted quite widely as one of the components um while i was still in my university job we had a um a biotech lab and i did uh do some testing on um people's hair and people's nails



 and all the results came back very high for barium strontium and a couple of other things which i can't remember now i can't remember um so barium uh can they protect themselves yes okay so i discovered that uh barium has an affinity to the sulfate iron so if you take um there's a thing called for joints i can't remember what it's called now something sulfate um that has a sulfate iron and i was on those tablets the second time i did my hair test so the first time i had very high barium the second time i had no barium at all and i was like oh that's a bit odd how have i gone from really high to nothing and i noticed i was taking these tablets for joint pains all right um i then tested this a few months later and i wasn't on those tablets anymore so i did another hair test and it was not as high as the first one but it was it was up again it was elevated again and i thought okay what else is sulfate um epsom salts okay so i took some epsom salts and repeated the test again zero so i'm not a chemist however from this what i'm thinking is that um what they've got is is is for these for the stuff that they're spraying they have what you might call an antidote in this case is anything with a sulfate iron barium has an affinity to sulfate so it takes the sulfur in line it forms barium sulfate barium sulfate is soluble and you excrete it in your urine so that's one example um strontium no idea there might be a way of removing strontium from your from your system i know that um oh god what's it called uh



 i can't remember now but there's a way of getting heavy metals and fluoride out of your system and it's uh it's a fruit and i can't remember the name of it now it's um i don't know it's gone um point being i do believe that there are ways that they can protect themselves okay either with an antidote or here's another thing some of the things that they are doing are what you might call combination therapy so individually that thing doesn't harm you but when you do that thing and that thing in the body they combine and they form something that's harmful and that harms you so they know that's fine and that's fine but just don't do them together okay i can't think of any examples off the top of my head but i'm i'm pretty sure that kind of thing exists as well um i know there are people who have done a lot of research into food additives and that's very much the case with food additives with chemicals they add to food so you know that's okay that's okay but when you put them together it forms this third chemical which is incredibly harmful

 so what you've just suggested then is if you eat say something from a supermarket that's highly produced it could have something in that will be affected by what's being sprayed but that they are unlikely to go to a supermarket and eat that kind of food they're more likely to have healthy organic food because they are super rich and got the resources so they can protect themselves that way whereas the vast majority of people ignorantly head off to the supermarket and buy nutrient-free chemicals disguised as something you might want to eat and somehow they manage to survive the next day god knows how that works but um so there could be a there could be a link in people who are having i don't know cancers or other problems escalated by a combination of the spraying and and food i mean it doesn't have to just be the spraying

 i mean i i'm pretty sure that goes on with the stuff that they are spraying right but it could be it could be anything it could be a combination of for instance you know um uh cured meats so bacon um uh anything but prosciutto because it's a protected brand so they it only has salt but they have things called um they're preservative so e250 e252 so sodium nitrite and potassium nitrate um i think at least one if not both are linked to colon cancer um they don't tell you this and as soon as you know i started broadcasting this on on um lbc i went on i think it was in 2016 on nick ferrari and i i put this forward and i said look you know avoid bacon with these things in it um again whether that individual chemical causes the colon cancer or whether you can eat bacon but just don't eat it with that or don't eat it with fluoride or don't eat it without i don't know but definitely you know what they're saying what they're trying to do we all know they're trying to get rid of meat okay they want to be um so they are adding these chemicals in and then going ah look see meat it's causing colon cancer don't eat meat um but it's not the meat that's causing colon cancer it's the preservatives which they now call curing salts because they don't want to call them preservatives because everyone's aware that preservatives are bad for you so what do they do they try and disguise them so they change the name to curing salts so again they're really sneaky and if you know people struggle with the idea that they're there are rooms full of people who sit there and go right how can we kill them today but they do that's exactly what they do you know they have creative teams who sit around and build a burg obviously you know we all know about that um who sit around and go okay well they know about this now i don't think that's really working anymore what else can be do i know uh how about we put that in that and oh well done jeeps you know jolly good action that one jolly good you know and this is it's i call it cat and mouse so they are constantly looking for new ways to poison us

 hmm and why i mean presumably they i mean if they wanted to kill us outright they could have done that donkeys ago well how well i i mean i suppose they could have poisoned the water with some something really horrible um or they could have sprayed something arsenic or something or gas or something in a much more concentrated form



 possibly the the the problem with that is you know then they're left with a legacy so if people survive they'll go oh yes do you remember when they tried to kill everybody right okay the idea really is to do it without being caught and this is why you know for instance i don't know how much i should say here but you know uh i've i've been attacked many times over the 10 years probably less so these days but when i was prolific at the point where i was going to take the government to court they were trying to kill me there's absolutely no doubt in my mind now they could have sent someone with a gun to shoot me but what happens then the police get involved and then there's an investigation and then they go oh hang on a minute he was an activist oh who's this guy he's linked to government and blah blah blah hang on what's going on here then it's really risky killing people is not as simple as you know it's not a thing they want to do unless they really have to they will do it and i think the guy who was shot on the train do you remember the um seven seven bombs after that yes yes so he was shot in the head on the train um on the grounds that he was a terrorist



 okay that's really risky stuff so he had obviously discovered something incredibly important that could have brought the system down so they had to get rid of him i was not such an immediate threat i was taking them to court you know they wanted to get rid of me blah blah so what they do is they poison you because poisoning is very difficult to prove and nobody thinks of it you know if you go oh i wonder if he was poisoned the police will go oh don't be silly you know and that's that unfortunately is the reaction of the police you know they're just starting to be silly as though nobody's ever been poisoned you know it's i mean it's ludicrous but the point being is you know they won't take drastic action unless they really have to it's much better to do soft slow kill you know also because they need some of us left they can't go rid of all of us who's going to build the houses you know robots can't build houses yet when they can they will get rid of us

 well robots won't need houses i suppose so okay now you wrote down pricing and i was going to ask you this must be costing to spray the skies continuously an absolute fortune and and not only that exactly how much but go on well we'll come to that in a second my other point was surely there must be factories producing all these quantities in huge numbers and and surely somebody somewhere in there must be going what is this used for and then what about the materials themselves is there a scarcity of what it is that they are shoving it will they run out or will they just keep going to something else so there's a number of

 curious questions okay so i wasn't going to go there because this is a this is a huge rabbit hole i wasn't going to go there in this talk but you know seeing as you ask the question

 well don't say anything that will get me banned but at the same time just it pushes in the direction of

 curiosity um okay they're not there there is no factory not on the ground okay again you cannot you cannot conduct an operation of this size and have lorries going around you know with with uh c-word chemicals written on it and a driver blah blah blah

 no how useful would it have been if that was it

 i know it would be like an economy of the c-word production factory you know with lorries coming in and out you know yeah i mean it's just unthinkable so what they do is um airports are very strictly controlled they have their own legislation you cannot go air side unless you have security clearance but it's it's even deeper than that so even within an airport the structure of the airport and this is something i've researched quite a lot of and i've i've spent countless nights at airports filming stake in the mail um even within the airports they have dedicated small teams of people who move the chemicals around nothing goes by land so it's flown in and it lands and it's taken from what i call tankers and it's offloaded and then it's distributed among all the smaller planes which then go out and fly all over the uk or whatever country we're discussing and they spray them locally okay we do have international sprayers as well so you know they will they will come from frankfurt or amsterdam are two really big hub airports um but that's what happens so where are they coming from the gulf of guinea is one place i've identified so it used to have an airstrip so if you imagine acra and then um another line if you draw another line based i'm trying to think where it is but if you go if you look on the map to zero zero east zero zero north that's pretty much where this is and there's a tiny little island there which i believe is the center of production for the um atlantic side of the world now i'm pretty convinced that there is also one on uh the pacific side of the world possibly diego garcia if you know what that is it's an american military base connected to mh 370 etc let's not digress um but what happens is um and i before i published this and i wish i'd never published it because as soon as i did they got rid of it um flights were coming in from south america they would divert to this island pick up the stuff and then they would go back to their path carry on switch on adbs again um and go to paris frankfurt amsterdam all the hub airports in europe and again they offload distribute amongst a smaller aircraft and then they go off and spray more locally okay so how do we know this happened simple because if you look at from são paulo or rio de gennaro you see a flight number and then you see it pop up at this location in zero now i remember when i first published this they they the the shills on facebook and and uh went absolutely bonkers and they were like oh you know this is just a glitch this is a glitch uh it's to do with the coordinates you know when something doesn't have a proper coordinate programmed into it it automatically reverts to zero nonsense utter nonsense because these planes were taking off disappearing appearing here you'd see them land and you'd see them take off again about a few hours later two hours later an hour later or something like that i can't remember and then they would appear again on their flight path and they would continue okay here's another thing try and book a flight back on one of these flights from são paulo or rio to london and it was 1200 quid the outbound flight was 400 quid no that worked because they want you to fly out so they've got a reason for the plane to be there but they don't want you flying back on that flight there were other cheap flights so of course everybody goes on the cheap flights all right because they know that that plane has got to have no passengers because you can't take your crew to an island in the gulf of guinea to load some stuff up without them talking to people so anyway that's um that's pretty much what i suspect is going on so they have a huge production facility in the middle of the gulf of guinea um they load these things on do you know what ulds are unit load devices no okay imagine the shape of a hull of an aircraft so those things you see at airports and they're kind of flat on the bottom and then they've got diagonal yeah yeah those things so what they've done is they converted those into pressurized tanks they look exactly the same as ulds you use for luggage but they're not they're pressurized okay um let's talk about airbus planes so airbus planes they never use the front hold anymore ever ever and do you remember years back they started going on about the weight of luggage oh you know you can't take that much luggage anymore it used to be 40 and it went to 30 now it's like 20 or 15 or you know because they need the weight they need all this extra weight they never use the front cargo holds anymore it's always the rear because the front cargo holds have the systems in all this stuff is quite well documented and explained on my website okay and this is what happens when you're a real world activist and you go out there and you sit at airports from three in the morning until 10 in the morning with a great big camera and a long lens you watch and you find out and you discover and when these tankers come in with all this stuff they land they've got a published passenger list it says 342 passengers or sold out blah blah blah nobody comes out you go to the arrivals you know blah blah blah from hong kong blah blah from south palo fully loaded you know all seats sold nobody comes out there's no one there it's only these unit load devices so they offload them there's no passengers on all the all all the windows open there's no lights on there's no one on the bloody plane it's empty so they're lying they are lying okay that's just one of the many many many many many things that i discovered through going out there and watching and thinking and working this stuff out so going full circle that's really what i believe is going on they've got at least one if not two centers of production but they're in the middle of the bloody ocean you can't get there no there's nothing on land anywhere in any country anywhere in the world because if they did that they could be found out whereas if you keep stuff contained within air side territory you're protected yes of course the dedicated team that i mentioned okay yes do pilots know about this and is there a c-word button so i don't know whether you've seen those ridiculous images you know in the cockpit and it's got the word the c-word and there's a big yeah no it's nonsense somebody somebody's made that just to take the mic out of activists okay there's no such thing so what i've worked out is that the systems are controlled by satellite



 okay so they're automated so and this is how you know they they they they look at the sky and they go well look there's a patch over there and sometimes you'll see the trails all ending at a certain point right you know because they're trying to cover this area or sometimes you'll see a big patch though where it's sort of blueish that they've forgotten they haven't covered and then suddenly you'll see all these lines and lines and lines and then and that goes white as well so these things are controlled by satellite so when they reach a certain altitude they switch on okay they're programmed the planes don't follow natural routes anymore that's the other thing okay they fly in very strange patterns to go over land to go over cities so a classic one which i've got on the front page of my website



 london is a particular target and the m4 corridor and south wales okay so that's a route that loads planes from central europe take amsterdam paris um uh frankfur so they will all rather like they go into canada and so from these airports they're going to canada they're going to central uh central america they're going to north america and all these different things you know you would expect them all to go off in a slightly different direction yes because that's the world circle route or the great circle route i think it's called um but they don't know what do they do they all fly and they converge in kind of um upper kent and they all fly over london at 16,000 feet really low broadcasting 37,000 feet but they're not they're under 20 they're sometimes as low as 16 here's here's the thing to do go to the top of the shard all right open flight radar on your phone and watch the planes go past now you can see the windows on these planes you can almost see the passengers they're so they're so low i almost swore there they're so low you can almost see the people okay and it's supposed to be at seven miles high no yes all right they all converge they go over london and then they will split off again and they often travel in pairs so they're doing combination therapy so you'll get a two engine plane and you'll get a four engine plane and initially what they would do is they'd just fly next to each other then when i started publishing the images of this they started doing that so they were crisscross you know and if you if you get um if you get flight radar and you get the membership or the upgraded version you can click on loads of different planes at the same time and it will show you all the different flight parts and that's how i did it i got a membership for a year or something like that and you learn so much more because you can track multiple planes at the same time so you can see where they've all come from how they've converged and how they do that one does that and they try and hide the fact that they're flying together but they're not you know i'm sorry they are they're absolutely flying in combination and the reason they do that is because you need all these different chemicals to form the layer of cloud you know anyway sorry um yeah i'm excited

 but um so i yeah i'm just uh i mean i normally keep these videos to an hour and and it may be that i'm going to have to get you back because we've only got a few minutes and there's a couple of things i want to do out but i mean that's you know that's a good a good intro i think that is a good intro but can i just want to i mean one of the things you said before we went you said i'm about solutions so i wanted to ask um is there any practical solution let me just throw this at you and i know what your answer is going to be because we mentioned it before we recorded people have been throwing videos around at the moment saying organic white vinegar warmed up the vapors of that dispel everything and um it does seem like that's a bit weird because it would seem to me that the factory that makes organic white vinegar would have permanent sunshine over their building and everyone would have noticed that one building had that and they don't so i can't really work out if that is true i haven't tried it i've only seen what goes around which may be hopium it may be fake or fake stuff or it may be just coincidence who knows

 uh i suspect it's nonsense and there's there's all sorts of stuff like this that's touted as you know there was a thing called chembusters where people stuck these tubes in the ground and you know and it was some kind of organ energy which dissipate you know it's nonsense you can't get rid of baryon from the air you can't get rid of plastic fibers from the air you know right there are things you can do to mitigate the damage that they do to you in your body possibly which one of which we discussed which was the baryon um can you mitigate the program even at a local level no i don't think you can um so no i i i i i think that's kind of nonsense really so

 dane wickington when he came on um last year said the the best thing is to get this out there so that the public opinion know exactly what's going on and that will end it is that your thought too

 yes but again you know people are there's two things we're programmed to dismiss the the the topic all right that's that's or sorry that's hurdle number one two um going back to what i was saying about the the the programming that might be going on from these from this nanotech in our throats people can't see it right now if you grab them and turn their head up and go look can you see that line they might be able to see it then but generally they walk around they can't they just see a thing yes of them they don't see any detail so you know it's hugely challenging you know and i i i did a lot of street campaigning i would go out there with banners and stand there with a table and leaflets and stuff like that and and people are like what what are you talking about you know not everybody you know

 they no no no no i appreciate but a vast majority do seem to be apathetic to everything

 yes and and and that's the problem so i don't believe that public awareness is ever going to be enough right okay so i think the only real solutions are direct action to block airports but that's really quite risky can you get enough people to do it and you would probably get arrested and so you're talking a kind of semi-revolution type scenario so is that realistic i don't know probably not at this juncture um the key thing is legal action so uh in 2017 i was about to initiate a judicial review against um the airlines uh two british airlines and the natural air traffic service for um spraying because i have enough evidence to prove that one the systems are illegal the ones they use you know the pipes we talked about they're illegal it's an illegal modification it is not approved by ersa so these pipes have been retrofitted and they're illegal okay so if we can get this into court and it's only 20 000 quid give or take for a judicial review that's not a huge sum of money no all right and i'm literally i i've i've been kind of semi-retired for the last few years because i got uh forced out of my job when they found out about my documentary and the fact i was doing a judicial review and stuff like that my university shut down my science research and they basically forced me into redundancy so that was a big shocker for me i had a son i was the only only parent and and i had to really say okay enough is enough i need to go back to looking after my son and trying to rebuild my life and you know sadly i never really got back into the campaign so i've been semi-retired for a while i'm literally you know this and the av14 talk have really kind of spurred me on so i'm trying to update the website and get i've got a buy me a coffee thing on on my website and so i'm i'm thinking about ways to try and revive this but i i i sincerely believe that legal action is the only thing that's really going to make a difference and even that who knows i mean as we all know you know tony blair created the supreme court



 and the supreme court is its only function really is to prevent the success of anything which threatens their authority so what is the supreme court the supreme court is a bunch of judges who are all on their side so once you get to the high court the high court is probably still relatively independent you know the judiciary is i don't know maybe 50 50 on our side and you know the rest of masons and um the supreme court is almost possibly a hundred percent bias so if you get to the high court which already costs vast amounts of money um you then have to go to the supreme court which costs even even more vast amounts of money and you'll fail however a judicial review the great thing about a judicial review is it will allow you um the possibility to get this thing into the papers and once it's in the newspapers they're you know going back to what i was saying you know people don't care a lot more people do care now you know when i i was talking i was out there campaigning in 2014 2015 um this is like years later so we're 2024 now okay so you know we're talking nine years um huge amounts of people know this is going on huge amounts of people are now seeing it okay and there is a chance that we can we can we can get enough people together to put so much pressure on them that they may actually concede and go okay we need i mean they've already backed off i know that for a fact okay so and that's why more and more people are waking up because what they're doing is less and less and less effective the more people notice yeah or sneaky they have to be the more they have to try and hide it the less effective it becomes so when i first discovered this in 2013 they were flying around in threes planes were flying really low in threes nobody could see it even i couldn't see it until suddenly you know did this stuff to my throat and it was like oh my god what the hell's that and then as soon as i started the website and got publishing um they started trying to hide it they all the planes suddenly you know they weren't you know they weren't invisible and on flight radar anymore they started publishing the flight data and they started flying you know a little bit higher and this that and the other so so they're on the back foot very much and it's not it's not just me i mean there's you know there's other people doing this as well so i'm not i'm not trying to you know take all the credit but they are definitely on the back foot so if we can get this thing into the papers with a legal challenge a judicial review i think we stand a chance of



 i don't know stand a chance of something i can't really say what that's something but you know if you just go out there and campaign and give out leaflets and stuff they don't care no it doesn't do any it doesn't achieve anything and i'm not i'm not i'm not trying to be dismissive of people who do that because i spent i spent years doing that i spent a fortune on banners and and leaflets and this and that and the other but um i don't know i i think we're winning but very slowly and i think legal action is the way forward i think that's probably my conclusion

 let's um well let's end there on a semi-positive note but obviously there is a lot more to this people can go to your website and look up and find out more you're not too far from me so we may have to meet up and have a coffee sometime you can tell yeah i mean you're just on the coast a little bit yeah absolutely um your website is look-up.org.uk i'll put the link in the description and as ian said there are lots of interesting videos to go and have a look at um what fascinating conversation um thank you so much that's been really enlightening and and and frightening at the same time however we've left people with a little bit of hope um and i guess the more people know about it the more and and if people can talk as you said right at the beginning in the scientific terms then it does help a hell of a lot um so there we go climate engineering is here and uh when you get a day of sunshine you've got to thank the nasty people for allowing us to have it i suppose yeah immediately what kind of world are we in uh dear oh dear ian thank you so much i really appreciate

 it rich it's been an absolute pleasure and thank you so much for having me on

 i will be back with more monologues and wonderful guests but in the meantime look after yourself and look up see if you can see it gargle with red wine see what comes out until the next time thanks for watching from ian and i goodbye
