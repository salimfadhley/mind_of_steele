 Welcome back to the channel thank you for joining me. Now we're going to talk about the chemical trails that are going on in the sky in a second and what the Met Office have to say about that and also another freedom of information request but before we get to that one of our wonderful lawful helpers on this channel and I can't say at the moment which one because we don't want to alert any authorities is who lives in a different country and you may know him he has been we've done various presentations together is a good bloke but he's in somewhat a pickle of a situation in his country and is looking to come back to the UK he was actually in the UK before and was doing some good stuff he was helping people left right and center and I was sending people off to him for help however he's trying to get out because there in where their country is in his country is the things are beginning to kick off and he wants to get out and I don't have room to put him up for a few days or a few weeks whilst he gets himself sorted so if anybody's got a spare room or he's got a an Airbnb or a property or anything like that and would help to like to help the cause do get in touch with me Richard at VOBES.com and we'll see what we can do obviously this gentleman is willing to work and be honorable and help out with any legal issues and things where I say lawful issues but that's anyway let me just leave it at that I just said I'd give a call out because we've got to help one another where we can meanwhile we're going to try and help everybody else understand what they're doing to the skies and interestingly enough somebody very kindly sent me what the Met Office have been saying about it and you'd think they would know what's going on well they admit it they admit what they're doing so I'm gonna put my headphones on here these little earbuds and let's have a little listen to what this gentleman is going to say about the situation and then we'll have a look at a freedom of information request so let me just get up the the appropriate screen here before me headphones fall out so here we go this is the Met Office let's hear what they've got to say

 geoengineering is a method to counterbalance the effects of global warming owing to the increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases

 so first of all he's making this the the erroneous



 conclusion that co2 is the problem and he from the Met Office Jim Harwood I think his name was yeah haywood Jim Haywood his name is from the Met Office and this and they're so they're you know giving us they're setting it up they're setting up the problem and they're telling us what we already know the myth of globe man-made global warming okay let's carry on so it says here what different types of geoengineering are there

 geoengineering or climate engineering generally falls into two specific categories the first of which is called carbon dioxide removal which as the name suggests is basically capturing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it

 that's not a sensible policy seeing as co2 is the gas of life we need that to grow plants and animals need to eat the plants and we obviously both I'm not sure that is a very sensible policy you're mucking about there with the atmosphere this is not good the

 second method is what's known as solar radiation management a solar radiation management differs from carbon dioxide removal in that what you're trying to do is reflect an additional amount of sunlight back out to space so solar radiation management is basically trying to reflect sunlight back out to space leading to a cooling to counterbalance the increases in greenhouse gases well

 it's very cold when the chemical trails are up there in the sky we certainly notice the difference I mean we're in the end of May we're fast approaching the summer and we're we're only given a few days of sunshine in the UK wherever you are it might be slightly different and the idea of reflecting the sun back out it's the sunlight is is the energy of life co2 and sunlight are two of the most important aspects that we want if you start mucking about by taking the Sun out of the equation you are effectively destroying life and this is so basic you cannot believe how ignorant and how stupid these people must be and these are people in positions of so-called knowledge and power and just peddling the same old rubbish that everybody knows is rubbish that they've been told and are paid to do

 there's been various different solar radiation management schemes that have been mooted as being possible all of which are basically trying to reflect sunlight back out to space

 why would you do that why why would you do why would you not use some common sense and go this is barking this planet has been around for millions of years we don't and and a few people on it running around like ants have somehow caused this warming really and it's all our fault so what we're going to do is interfere with the planet by reflecting away the sunlight and potentially kill us all off you are

 mad one of the most popular is to inject some reflective material into the stratosphere this mimics really the the impact of volcanic eruptions

 so we want more we want to imply that there are more volcanic eruptions that's a good place to live is it by chucking out stuff into the atmosphere which presumably will eventually fall down and are we not breathing all of this

 which have been shown on the observational record to cool climate there's another method which is artificial brightening of low-lying stratocumulus clouds if you inject some aerosol into these low-lying stratocumulus clouds you can brighten them and of course when you've got a brightening of the planet you're reflecting more sunlight back out to space

 yeah and you're decimating life on the earth I mean it's bonkers isn't it isn't this not just absolutely bonkers

 the two most popular solar radiation management techniques that have in the press at the moment

 and one of the pros and cons it says here for geoengineering

 carbon dioxide removal is often thought of as a relatively benign kind of geoengineering because you're simply reducing the amount of carbon dioxide and and people in the atmosphere it's not quite as simple as that because a lot of the land that would be used for general agricultural practices like they are at the moment would have to be converted into land for specific growing of biomass burning so there's certainly some ecological implications associated with CDR solar radiation management the main conclusions that are coming out of the solar radiation management studies is that you cannot get a no temperature change earth no global mean next temperature change without there being some regional side effects so although you can hold the temperature of the earth fixed at say present-day conditions you will get regional responses in it in both temperature for instance the poles will warm up more than the equator

 yes so in other words you're meddling around and you're likely to get side effects and we know that side effects are can be extremely and you can't plan for them and it's going to be terrible for some people so why muck about with the atmosphere leave it alone stop injecting all this stuff into the atmosphere which we know of course I mean and he's putting a very general case about it isn't he he's telling us that it's you know benign and all of this and putting it into as friendly words as is possible but of course he's not actually telling you that the other substances they're shoving in there with the aluminium and the barbarium is it and and the various other he's not telling you the nefarious things about decimating the farmland about trying and the dark forces and they're trying to kill off the food the great famine that will come because things won't grow the poisoning is of the atmosphere the poison all of it is and he probably doesn't know that he probably only knows the tiny bit the story you know that is plausible and maybe it makes sense well no it doesn't make any sense whatsoever stop meddling with our atmosphere it's our planet nobody asked you you didn't come to the people of the planet or plot to the people of the country and say is it all right if we do this we think has a problem is it okay because you've got to breathe this in you need to okay it no we need to say absolutely not this is not happening so the Met Office are telling you what's going on they said they're spraying this aerosol stuff in there but let us just have a look at this email here because this is a an email that came in from a chap called Shane and he says hi Richard this is an email he's gonna show us in a second I sent to the Civil Aviation Authority and the one I received back I'm sure they have a scripted answer for all it's shocking they treat us with such contempt and insult our intelligence at every instance thanks Richard I thought you like their response so bear in mind the Met Office has told us that this is what they are doing so this is what Shane sent to the Civil Aviation Authority says to whom it may concern I'm making a freedom of information request regarding the geoengineering and stratospheric aerosol injections taking place over Bedford in the UK on behalf of myself and my community please can you provide the names of the companies or branch of military carrying this out very good question please can you provide all information on the flights on the dates of the first of the third 2024 to present day as this is when we started recording the flights and the planes and have recorded them so he's telling the Civil Aviation we know what you're doing thanks very much Shane from Bedford and here is so he says that and here is the response and the response is let me just move that so we don't get distracted so thank you for contacting us they say can we put your mind at rest aircraft are not allowed to dispense any chemicals into the atmosphere in the UK really and yet we're all seeing it this is the Civil Aviation Authority but maybe they don't know what their pilots are doing what you're actually witnessing oh here we go here we go this will be good here's the truth at last what you're witnessing is the formation of persistent condensation trails Oh contrails yes I think we're being conned again by aircraft transisting along the air traffic service routes also known as airways that are established over the UK contrails are formed when water vapor which is emitted from aircraft engines as part of the combustion process comes into contact with the surrounding air their formation is completely dependent upon the app with the ambient atmospheric conditions such as temperature pressure and humidity if the air is dry low level of humidity the trail will only appear as it were for a short plume behind the aircraft whereas if the surrounding area will close the saturation high level humidity the contrail will evaporate slowly or not at all or will be what do you mean not at all you're telling me that it I mean that in and of itself what you're telling me that an airplane could go to a certain height and the the vapor will just not evaporate at all ever it's just gonna stay up there you want us to believe that really this is ridiculous and will be long and persistent occasionally spreading into cirrus like cloud really that explains why contrails appear behind some aircraft and not others and then it changes the size of the font as if that was just cut and paste of course what's the standard reply I hope this information is helpful and alleviates concerns about the contrails you're seeing you can find more information here at aircraft contrails government UK and here at chemtrails debunked oh yeah like we're gonna go and and see that that's the aero society calm and it also finally goes on to say the BBC has also recently I'd like we're gonna you know believe the BBC they've covered an article chemtrails what's the truth behind the conspiracy theory yeah a general inquiries team external information services civil aviation theory blah blah blah and you can see that the emails are there inquiries at CAA co.uk and their website is www.caa.co.uk they're even on Twitter so if you want to at UK underscore CAA and tell them what you think about their response then you can do that this is disgusting and is blatant lies and our skies are continually being filled up with this nonsense they are lying to us we know it they know we know it and they're squirming to try and show something but we must get to the bottom of this for otherwise this is the end of humanity isn't it not that we want to worry about it we will find a way out of this but we've got to wake people up and let them know what is exactly going on and these lies of contrails is just not going to wash thanks for watching
