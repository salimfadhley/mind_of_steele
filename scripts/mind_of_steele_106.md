Mind of Steele 106
---

A power fantasy is a form of escapist fiction in which characters have exceptional and sometimes supernatural abilities: Powers that allow them characters to dominate their environment. Powers that defy the known laws of physics.
The first person to witness a bird in flight was envious of its freedom; Any man who lost a fight dreams of being stronger, bigger and tougher. And any sexually frustrated incel, like Soverign Pete dreams of X-ray vision... even though that would just let you see a bunch of bones and stuff... and would be very boring.
But there's a escapist power fantasy that we all can identify with - one that literally ever man and woman has fantasized about: The power of free power.


Everybody I feature on mind of steele is a scammer. They all have grifts. 

Mark Steele, for example is a fear scammer. He tells a scary story, and then promises to fix a problem that doesn't really exist, if only you subscribe to his organisation. 

Richard Vobes' business model is all about taking money to feature charlatans, con-mean and whackaloons on his channel. The Richard Vobes show is all about monetising other people's stupidity. It turns out that other scammers will pay to access an audience of gullible nitwits who are easily parted from their cash.

> Clip: What if I told you that everything you know about energy is about to change? Imagine never having to stop for gas again. Never having to charge your car. Never having to worry about fuel prices. Sounds impossible, right? That's exactly what they said about Tesla.

In the public imagination, the inventor and electronic engineer, Nikola Tesla is remembered as some kind of shamanic genius. He's considered a spiritual folk hero whose almost mystical discoveries transcended the known laws of physics. According to legend, he invented devices so radically ahead of their time, our modern science has yet to catch up.

And accordiong to they mythical version of this story: Tesla had invented a energy transmission technology that would have rendered fossil fuels irrelevant. We would need no more power stations. No batteries, just limitless, energy plucked from thin air.

But why don't we have such a technology? Apparently, the evil robber-barons of industry, the oligarchs of the early 20th Century, decided that such a technology would be too disruptive. They shut it down to preserve Big Oil. And so, the world was deprived of the staggering potential of this fabulous invention. 

Electronic Engineers remember Tesla, not because of his technical brilliance or contribution to the field... but mostly because he presents a sobering warning of what might happen if you trust your intuition over the laws of physics:

Much of Tesla's career was marked by hubris and failure. Perhaps the most ludicrous and preventable failure of all was his Wardenclyffe Tower project. A ambitious machine intended to transmit wireless energy across the globe. 

Tesla had't grappled with a little thing called the Inverse Square law, something he should have known about; he was after all a former electrical engineering student. 

This unfortunately non-negotiable fact of physics meant that anything close to the transmitte meant that only a few hundred meters away, Tesla's invention would be barely powerful enough to light a small bulb.

Tesla is a warning to anybody who trusts their intuition and thinks the theory doesn't matter. And that dear friends, is why electronic engineers do not celebrate Nikola Tesla.

But Speaking of celebration, there's one happening in Zimbabwe right now:

> Clip: The streets of Harare, Zimbabwe's capitol erupted with celebrations and social media exploded in reactions. The energy companies went quiet.

I'm sure you are wondering why the people of Zimbabwe are celebrating. Well, it's because of a man named Maxwell Chicombutso. He's apparently Africa's Nikola Tesla, an inventor of renown and panache who is on the verge of bringing a ray of hope to his beleaguered homeland. According to Zimbabwe's leading YouTubers, this inventor is about to unveil a technology that will change the world.

World-changing may be understatement, how about epoch-defining. When this technology is revealed we are going to have to start a new calendar. One in which all of the days and every month is named after one man: Maxwell Chicombutso.

> Clip: Meet Maxwell Chicombutso, a self-taught inventor from Zimbabwe who claimed to have invented a device that lets you drive your car or power your house without ever needing to visit the gas station or use conventional electricity.

If you ware watching this video as part of a historical retrospective about YouTubers who correctly predicted the future; Hi, my name is Raynard Wilson, a creator of a midly humorous YouTube show called Mind of Steele; The show was named after another spiritual folk-hero shamanic Genius; A man called Mark Steele who was widely mocked in his time for his claim that Lamp Posts were a form of deadly energy weapon

-- Steele insert

but his claims were eventually proved true in the Gateshead 5G massacre of 2027. 

I'm making this video on Maxwell the 21st in the Month of Chicombutso in approximately the year -1 of what you probably call the pre-Chicombutso Era. This was a dark and barbaric time. A time before the golden age of free energy.

But then came Maxwell Chicombutso; a man whose origins can never be known. A man who rose from the depths of poverty, but had an uncanny knowledge beyond his years; Somewhat like the Emperor all mankind from the Warhammer 40K franchise. 

Now, I'm not saying that Maxwell Chicombutso is an incarnation of the divine ruler of all mankind, becuase: That would be a form of ecclesiastical heresy, punished by being flayed alive. But I'm sure you haven't failed to notice that they are both reclusive, mysteruous figures with a grand design for humanity.

Maxwell Chicombutso is living proof that a man who knows no limits can achieve anything; in this case building an entire industry in defiance of the laws of thermodynamics. 

> Clip: Chicombutso wasn't launching a car. He was launching a technology that could be put into any car in the world.

Of course, some people watching this demonstration may have been skeptical; after all Maxwell Chicombutso wasn't the first 'inventor' who claimed to have obtained a free energy machine. 

 wasn't even the first man from Africa who had made such a claim. Nor was the the first man of African origin, previousy featured on Mind of to have claimed to have such a device: That honor goes to Sacha Stone, who you may remember is promising to power his Kentucky micro-nation entirely on 'Zero Point Energy'.

But Chicombutso is different. He's not just making claims, he's demonstrating his technology in action. And what could be more convincing than seeing a car, admittedly an electric car, powering a fridge. 

> Clip: This is a generator. I think if you can go to the fridge you can see. It is going to plug in and you'll see that the fridge is going to be powered by a car. Like I said, you can buy a car. You don't need to have a generator to home. You use your car.

How is this possible? What uncanny miracle of science is this?

All your life you grew up with the dogma that cars and fridges live in separate universes; One is for transport, the other for food preservation. Mad men have tried to combine these technolgies. They tried and failed? No, they tried and died. 

I know you just rewound the video to look at the fridge - was the light on? Is this some kind of uncanny CGI special effect? Did Maxwell Chicombutso hire the special effects director of James Cameron's Avatar franchise to produce this an illusion. A car powering a fridge; this can't be real, but it is. 

You saw it with your own eyes. A car powered fridge.

The potenential. A fusion of car and frdge. Imagine a fridge on wheels. A fridge that can go anywhere, delivering chilled beverages thirsty. A car with some kind of refrigeration device that blows cool air at you while you drive. 

Don't call me a dreamer, I've seen the future of science, and it's name is Maxwell Chicombutso.

> Clip: He explained that the energy used in this innovation is called "microsonic energy." Now this energy is found in the air just like many other energies, like radiation energy. But then the energy is very minimal. But Chicombutso has found a way to amplify the radio waves and use it in large scale.

It's all starting to make sense: Micro, meaning very small, sonic, meaning sound, and energy meaning... energy: You put them together and get a kind of meaningless gibberish intended to confound and impress the terminally uneducated. 

> Clip: This is our self-powered TV that we have designed. The first thing in the world to have such kind of a technology, where a television is powered with a radio frequency. So as you can see, right now I'm powering this television. Behind the television you can see that there is a microsonic energy device, this box. This is the device that is converting radio frequencies into pure energy. As you can see, the power of the cable was supposed to be here. On all traditional televisions, power comes here. But there is no power as you can see.

We already have a very popular machine that can turn electromagnetic radiation into electrical power - that's a photovoltaic cell; a solar cell. But this machine is apparently something quite different.

 A machine that allegedly converts electromagnetic radiation, which is already 'pure energy' into an even purer form 'pure energy' is possibly the most zen thing I've ever heard of. 

> Clip: You know how your radio picks up music from thin air. Those are radio frequencies, invisible waves travelling all around us. Chicombutso figured out how to turn these waves into pure energy. Think of it like a radio that plays power instead of music.

Thing is, we already have a device that can convert electromagnetic waves into pure energy... it's called an antenna. And from what we saw of the device, it doesn't have one. In fact, it's placed inside the metal cavaty where a car would normally have an engine. That's the worst place to receive an electromagnetic signal, especially if that was what powered your car.

> Clip: You see, Chicombutso isn't just building one car. He has created something much more bigger, an energy system that could power any vehicle around the world. And he is really to partner with major auto manufacturers to transform the entire industry.

And why aren't the world's major car manufacturers queuing up to partner with Chicombutso? Why is he only selling this technology direct to consumer... via a series of Zimbabwean youtube influencers? 

I think it's because only the best and most highly coveted products are sold this way. 

There's no class of people more highly respected; less easily corrupted than social media influencers. 

No social media influencer would ever accept money to promote a product that they didn't truly believe in. We YouTubers are men and women of honor, and any suggestion that we are in fact needy, attention-seeking creeps who would tell any lie for a few Zimabwean dollars is a false and hurtful allegation. 

After all, this isn't about money - it's about changing the world:

> Clip: 10,000 United States dollars. That's the starting price of Markzoo Jikumbutsu's Microsonic energy-powered devices for vehicles

Chicombutso isn't just the second coming of Nikola Tesla - he's the reincarnation of Elon Musk; Now I know some of you will be wanting to urgently correct me:

"But Raynard", you are thinking, "How can Elon Musk have been reincarnated as Chicombutso when he is still alive" - please stop thinking in such linear terms. 

If reincarnation is possible, then why not also time travel? And if time-travel and reincarnation are both possible, then why not the possibility of an affordable over-unity device capable of producing enough energy to accelerate a vehicle to 200kph, without consuming any fuel? 

I'd like to think that at the end of his life, Elon Musk, the enlightened spiritual folk-hero shamanic genius... He realised that his life's work was incomplete. He was not yet ready to ascend to immaterium for there was one promise as yet unfulfilled. He hadn't yet delivered the Tesla full-self drive feature which he promised in 2018. This omission so heavily on his soul, so when the golden throne was no longer able to sustain his mortal form, he chose to project his consciousness back in time and took on the form of the young Maxwell Chickumbotso, the young African genius.

> Changed order: Clip: One final check of the battery voltage revealed a shocking result. Not only had the machine outlasted the expected battery life, but the batteries were still fully charged. This proved that the device was being powered from an unknown energy source.

See, can you think of a better endorsement than this anonymous american scientist who might be an actor? But if the glowing review of this possibly fake scientist isn;t enough, consider that this device has been honored by the nation's leading engineer: 

> Clip: The Vice Chancellor of the Harare Institute of Technology, Professor Engineer Quintin Kanhukamwe, has thrown his full support behind Maxwell, Chicombutso's inventions,

When I saw that, wondered if it was real. 

Did the vice-chancellor of the nation's most prestiguious technology university endorse Maxwell Chicombutso's invention? The answer is yes, he did. Here's the post from the Harare Institue of technology's official facebook page. 

The vice-chancellor name-checks Maxwell Chicombutso and his invention by name. As the vice-chancellor says: Africa's time is now.

If that endorsement still isn't enough for you, consider this stonker of an endorsement: 

> Clip: The elusive inventor finally made an appearance at the state house where he met Zimbabwe president, Edi Mungagwa, allaying all the fears that he was dead.

I'm going to assume that nobody presumed the President of Zimbabwe was dead; I think he was refering to Maxwell Chicombutso - meaning this is some kind of double miracle; The inventor is alive. He has died and risen to bring us free energy. 

No wonder the people of Harare have been celebrating!

-- reuse the clip from before of people partying.

But not every Zimbabwean is convinced. Some ungrateful wretches have refused to dance with glee at for the rebirth of our savior: 

> Clip: Maxwell claimed he developed the car in partnership with the Chinese automaker, Ka'i. However, after checking their official website and social media accounts, I found no mention of any collaboration with him.

Funny, that. But perhaps they are just keeping quet to maximize the surprise when this product launches. 

Anyway, what about all of Maxwell's other products?

> Clip: I did a quick reverse image search and found an exact match being sold on Amazon under a different name.

Hmm, but what about his invention? You know the thing that powers the car. Surely that's real - after all he has a patent for it?

> Clip: **Maxwell also claimed that he tried to file a patent for his invention, but it was denied. If Maxwell's technology was truly groundbreaking, why was he denied a patent? According to him, it was denied because it defies the laws of physics.

It's like the forces of chaos are allied against the noble Maxwell Chicumbotso. This brave inventor who is being denied the opprtunity to protect his invention... merely on the basis that the world's patent offices do not wish to be flooded with preposterous submissions for implausible devices.

How is Maxwell going to protect this brilliant invention without the ability toi patent his invention? 

> Clip: How do you protect our technology? That's why we took the participatory route. Our design is kept, the recipe is kept in three countries. And the people who are keeping it, they don't even know each other.

But will that work for long? Once this device is released to the public - what is to prevent another engineer from taking it apart in order to find out how it works?

> Clip: And it is with a self-destructive technology. One of the 150 wires on this car, if you try to assemble five of them, we will classify. You destroy the microsonic device, both of the software and the hardware. So we put a small amount of it to detonate it, but that cannot harm anyone. But if you just try to deploy it, you deploy.

A bomb. What could be safer and more sensible than a tiny explosive inside a device which is also capable of producing limitless free energy.
