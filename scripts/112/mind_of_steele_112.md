> Clip 01 - Simon Goldberg: this is a promise to pay money, right? A promise to pay money. Therefore, it cannot be money, correct? It's a promise to pay money. And we call this cash,



> Clip 02 - Simon Goldberg: Now, if a promise to pay money is cash, and is treated as cash, on the books of the bank, right? Have a think about when you signed a loan agreement, Do you promise to pay money? Yes or no?



> Clip 03 - Simon Goldberg: Now, I know the answer is yes. You do promise to pay money, what does it become the moment you sign it? What is it treated as? It's treated as cash,



> Clip 04 - Simon Goldberg: By signing this document, okay, I have turned this document into a commercial instrument, a negotiable instrument. You could call it a security. In other words, this is the bank's security for the loan.



> Clip 05 - Simon Goldberg: This document is the loan because by applying my signature to the document, as I mentioned, I turned it into a commercial instrument, negotiable instrument, a security, you could call it a money market instrument. But in essence, this document, this physical piece of paper is to be treated as cash.



> Clip 06 - Simon Goldberg:  And then I go and spend that 10,000 pounds the bank is then going to expect me to make repayments on a regular monthly basis. Those repayments will form part capital, part interest.


> Clip 07 - Simon Goldberg:  Now, the problem is when you've cleared your loan off, you don't get this document back. All right? You do not get this document back. And the reason you do not get this document back is because the bank has sold this piece of paper. All right? They've sold it.



> Clip 08 - Simon Goldberg:  when the bank is actually enforcing repayment of the loan, repayment, in other words, double payment of the loan, they've already been paid off, right? They've already been paid off because they sold the piece of paper.



> Clip 09 - Simon Goldberg:  When the contract is finished, you are supposed to get your contract back so that you can tear it up. All right. And thereby, because there's no proof of any contract in existence, no one can hold you liable for any alleged obligation.



> Clip 10 - Simon Goldberg:  If the bank wants to sell this loan to an alternate organization, then the loan with the bank is paid off. Regardless of whether the alternate organization tries to collect money from me, the bank has no right to come chasing me for any money because it's been paid off.



> Clip 11 - Simon Goldberg:  Well, let's pretend that this document was a gold watch and that I'd gone to the bank and offered security in the form of a gold watch in order to obtain the loan facility.



> Clip 12 - Simon Goldberg:  Are you telling me that at the end of the loan facility, it would be acceptable for the bank to sell the gold watch and keep the proceeds?



> Clip 13 - Simon Goldberg:  That doesn't sound right, does it? Now, the only difference or the only thing that I've changed in the explanation there is that I've substituted a gold watch for this piece of paper


> Clip 14 - Simon Goldberg: Someone induces you into a contract or if the bank member of staff asks you to sign this document, knowing that it's fraudulent and the top boys do, I don't buy it for one second when they're picking up their hundred million pound pay packets, as Bob Diamond did.


> Clip 15 - Simon Goldberg:  Because the bank is holding the piece of paper, all right, the chances are from that perspective, okay, it's now going to consider itself to be the beneficiary. However, the bank is actually the trustee. What it needs to do is trick you into becoming the trustee. And so it does that by asking for payments. And the moment that you make payments, you now become the trustee. All right?


> Clip 16 - Simon Goldberg:  I know my peers will always kind of come out with this comment, but please, please, please go do your own research. Please attempt to prove this wrong. All right? If I've got anything wrong, please let me know. Okay?
