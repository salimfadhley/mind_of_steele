Mind of Steele 112

Link 1 (Intro): In the last episode, we briefly met Simon Goldberg—also known, somewhat inexplicably, as The Spaniard. He was the one interviewing Sovereign Pete, effortlessly making Pete look like a complete imbecile. And while it might be tempting to think Simon was just doing a public service—exposing Pete’s nonsense with a calm, rational voice - after watching today's video your impression of Simon might change. 

Mine certainly did. 

Simon Goldberg is, in my opinion, one of the most shamelessly dishonest people I’ve ever studied online. If Sacha Stone is the spiritual con-man, Simon could be his financial twin—except, of course, Sacha Stone is also his own financial twin, so maybe we’ve discovered some kind of grifter covergent evolution. If every arthropod eventually evolves into a crab; will every con-artist eventually evolve into something a lot like Simon Goldberg?

And before we start; and because Simon is famously a litigious man - everything in this video is 'just my opinion'

-- Ricard Vobes "my opinion" montage

But unlike Richard Vobes, whose opinions are founded on nothing; Mine is informed by the videos that Simon Goldberg has published on his own YouTube channel, 'White Rabbit Trust', and documents leaked from former members of his financial cult, 'You and Your Cash'. Having spent hours watching through his rather tedious videos, I saw a man who claims to be an expert in the financial system, but is clearly pushing a set of wildly wrong, long-discredited ideas. I see him pushing emotional buttons, stoking outrage, and I don't see a lot of difference between somebody like Sovereign Pete and Simon.

So why do I think Simon Goldberg is so awful? Let’s start with how he likes to 'red-pill' people on the Internet:

 > Clip 01 - Simon Goldberg: this is a promise to pay money, right? A promise to pay money. Therefore, it cannot be money, correct? It's a promise to pay money. And we call this cash,
 
Link 2: You've  heard this one before—the tired old claim that a British banknote is actually a promissory note, and that means it's not real money. Simon Goldberg parrots this nonsense too, suggesting that a banknote's promise “to pay the bearer on demand” somehow proves that it isn’t actually money. Financial charlatans often make this kind of claim, but it's by no means the weirdest item on Simon's bizarre tasting menu of financial conspiracies:

Simon Goldberg runs a private membership scheme called You and Your Cash. For a tidy annual sum—up to £1,500 for the Bronze package—Simon offers to help members recover money they supposedly overpaid to the United States Internal Revenue Service. Yes, you heard that correctly: British citizens being promised a refund from the IRS. The scheme revolves around filing a U.S. tax document called a 1099-OID, a form designed for American residents who’ve received taxable interest income from original issue discounts. In the conspiracy theory version, these forms are the means to reclaim thousands in secret government payouts.

But here’s the obvious problem: British citizens don't pay tax to the IRS. They don’t file 1099s. They have no taxpayer identification number, no U.S. income, and no legal basis to file such claims. The notion that the IRS would be sending out cheques to UK residents based on forged paperwork is not just wrong—it’s potentially criminal. Filing false tax documents with the IRS is fraud, and even if someone were naïve enough to try it, the outcome wouldn’t be riches. It would be a big red flag on a database in Washington D.C.

What Simon is really selling here isn’t a service. It’s a dangerous fiction. The contractual documents leaked from his group show a tangled mess of conditions, disclaimers, secrecy clauses, and penalties for breaking the code of silence. This is not how legitimate financial services operate. It's how grifters build traps: create a system full of obfuscation, dangle the prospect of easy money, and watch desperate people walk right in.

 > Clip 02 - Simon Goldberg: Now, if a promise to pay money is cash, and is treated as cash, on the books of the bank, right? Have a think about when you signed a loan agreement, Do you promise to pay money? Yes or no?
 
Link 3: Frequent viewers of this show will already recognise this flim-flam. It’s the idea that a signed loan agreement magically becomes money the moment your pen hits the page. We've heard this nonsense before, not just from Simon Goldberg, but from Richard Vobes and a revolving door of his YouTube guests.

But here's the difference: Richard Vobes plays nicely with others—he promotes his fellow grifters and participates in the circle-jerk echo-chamber that is UK conspiracy scene. 

Simon Goldberg's strategy involves attacking his peers. He ridicules them, exposes their contradictions. He calls them charlatans, which of couse they are. And in doing so, he promotes himself as the only financial visionary who can see through it all. 

He probably is smarter than them, I mean just look at Sovereign Pete, it's not exactly a high bar, is it?

-- Pete Stone, Maritime law clip

But why be mean to sov-cit whackaloons like Pete? 

I think this is just business. If Pete takes a pound from a gullible victim, that's a pound Simon cannot earn through his schemes. Instead, by tearing down the competition and cultivating an air of superiority, he positions himself as the Mr Big Balls of the conspiracy world. People will think he's the only one telling the truth. Desperate nitwits looking to offload their cash will flock to Simon and not Pete.

The irony, of course, is that there's nothing original here. He’s just found a different way package an old conspiracy theory. Simon and Pete tell essentially the same story. 

 > Clip 03 - Simon Goldberg: Now, I know the answer is yes. You do promise to pay money, what does it become the moment you sign it? What is it treated as? It's treated as cash,

Link 4: Simon’s magic trick depends on you believing something truly impossible. Much like the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation—where a wafer becomes the literal flesh of a crucified deity. Simon wants us to accept that the moment you sign a loan agreement, it transforms that piece of paper into money - it's a miracle!

-- it's a miracle clip

But a signed loan agreement isn’t cash. Not remotely. Cash is universal—legal tender you can use to buy groceries, pay your rent, or shove into a vending machine in exchange for a bag of Hula-Hoops. It’s anonymous, immediate, and doesn't require mutual consent to transfer. A contract, by contrast, has none of those properties. You can’t whip out a loan agreement at a petrol station and expect to pay for a tank of E10. You can’t use it to pay your council tax. You can’t settle your round at the pub by an agreement from your wallet and saying, “Don’t worry, I got this one.”

Simon Goldberg's grift is built on the bizarre fantasy that anyone can conjure money into existence simply by scribbling their name on a piece of paper. He seems genuinely convinced that this is how money creation works—but of course, it isn't. The entire premise requires you to believe that banks, governments, and financial systems have somehow overlooked the incredible secret power of your biro.

> Clip 04 - Simon Goldberg: By signing this document, okay, I have turned this document into a commercial instrument, a negotiable instrument. You could call it a security. In other words, this is the bank's security for the loan.

Link 5: Simon says that you could call this document a security. Sure, you could also call it fermented yak butter, astral projection, an emotional support mongoose, or literally any other absurdly inappropriate thing—but it still isn’t a security.

A financial security is a tradable asset that holds monetary value, like shares in a company, bonds issued by governments or corporations, or derivatives. Simon’s loan agreement clearly isn't this, because it’s neither tradable nor does it represent any investment holding value.

It also isn't a "securitised loan," which is something else entirely—where a bank bundles multiple loans together, turns them into tradable investment packages, and sells them to investors. Again, Simon’s document isn't bundled or packaged with other loans, nor traded to investors as part of a larger financial instrument.

And finally, it isn't "security" in the sense of collateral—something that a borrower might pledge to guarantee repayment of a loan, like a house or a car. Simon’s loan agreement is nothing more than an individual’s promise to repay borrowed funds. Calling it a security—no matter how confidently Simon Goldberg repeats the term—doesn't magically transform it into something valuable or tradable. It's just a basic piece of paperwork, and Simon Goldberg remains a deeply confused man.

 > Clip 05 - Simon Goldberg: This document is the loan because by applying my signature to the document, as I mentioned, I turned it into a commercial instrument, negotiable instrument, a security, you could call it a money market instrument. But in essence, this document, this physical piece of paper is to be treated as cash.
 
 Link 6: Simon wants us to believe that this signed piece of paper is a "money market instrument," whatever that's supposed to mean. He's hoping we'll picture a frenzied trading floor—perhaps something straight out of that Eddie Murphy film, what was it? Trading Places, the one where brokers shout bids for frozen concentrated orange juice in a crowded Chicago trading pit. Simon would like you to think your personal loan documents are valuable commodities, changing hands among financial traders in some mysterious corner of the global market.
 
 But there’s no such market, and no such pit. Simon relies on ambiguity, confusion, and his audience's willingness to accept vague nonsense without checking the facts—because, of course, they're not facts at all. His entire business model depends on misunderstanding financial systems. He wants his followers convinced that money creation is arbitrary and unfair, a conspiracy that keeps them poor and indebted.
 
 And, ironically, there is a fraud being committed here—but not by banks, building societies, or legitimate lenders. The real fraud is perpetrated by people like Simon Goldberg, whose bad financial advice traps people in confusion, debt, and eventual legal trouble.
 
 > Clip 06 - Simon Goldberg:  And then I go and spend that 10,000 pounds the bank is then going to expect me to make repayments on a regular monthly basis. Those repayments will form part capital, part interest.

Link 7: This is exactly how loans are supposed to work. You receive a lump sum up-front, and in exchange, you gradually pay it back over time—usually in smaller, manageable increments—until you've repaid the original amount plus interest. Simon Goldberg, however, seems to think there's something inherently sinister about this arrangement.

It's as if he's stumbled onto a copy of Dostoevsky’s "Crime and Punishment," where a desperate Russian student borrows money from an elderly pawnbroker and considers not paying it back—except Simon appears to have entirely misunderstood who the villain of the story is. He's convinced himself that the signed loan agreement is somehow as valuable as the actual money loaned, and therefore when banks don’t return this piece of paper, they've magically doubled their profits.

Simon's scenario isn't just detached from reality—it's actively deceptive. It's not that he doesn't understand how loans and repayment work; it's that his misrepresentation is very deliberate and profitable. 

He’s promoting the notion that you can magically escape your debts by following his secret formula. Of course, the catch is that you must first pay Simon himself a hefty fee. The end result is predictable: instead of reducing their debts, Simon's followers end up poorer, deeper in trouble, and more indebted than ever.

 > Clip 07 - Simon Goldberg:  Now, the problem is when you've cleared your loan off, you don't get this document back. All right? You do not get this document back. And the reason you do not get this document back is because the bank has sold this piece of paper. All right? They've sold it.
 
 Link 8: Simon wants us to think that the bank has already been paid back—and if that were true, then defaulting on your loan would seem like a victimless crime. In Simon’s version of reality, the bank has somehow double-dipped on the loan, getting paid twice for every pound you borrowed. That’s the seductive part of the grift: if the bank has already made their money, then maybe you don’t owe them anything at all.
 
 But let’s entertain Simon’s theory for a moment. Suppose we accept that the loan agreement itself has some monetary value—what would that value be? Well, if anything, it would come from the expectation of future repayments. A bank might package together lots of loans and sell them based on the future revenue those loans will generate.
 
 But if the loan has already been paid back—if there’s no future income stream—then that agreement is worthless. Its only remaining function is as an administrative artefact, a record that the debt existed and was settled. In other words, there is no “asset” here for the bank to double-dip on.

> Clip 08 - Simon Goldberg:  when the bank is actually enforcing repayment of the loan, repayment, in other words, double payment of the loan, they've already been paid off, right? They've already been paid off because they sold the piece of paper.

Link 9: It’s often said that you can’t con an honest man. The flip side of that coin is just as true: dishonest people are surprisingly easy to scam. Especially those who believe they’ve found a loophole—a way to enjoy the benefits of a loan without having to pay it back.

This kind of person might not understand the enforcement mechanisms that underpin financial systems. They might not grasp the legal and contractual obligations that exist to prevent widespread fraud. But they’re drawn to Simon Goldberg’s narrative because it offers the seductive fantasy that their debts have already been paid by some invisible hand, that the £10,000 they borrowed, perhaps to buy one of Maxwell Chikombutso's free energy machines.  

They want to believe that the money somehow no longer needs to be repaid.

> Clip 09 - Simon Goldberg:  When the contract is finished, you are supposed to get your contract back so that you can tear it up. All right. And thereby, because there's no proof of any contract in existence, no one can hold you liable for any alleged obligation.

Link 10: And to really sell that fantasy, Simon dangles a final piece of theatre: the promise that when your loan is settled, you should get the contract back—so you can tear it up. But why would you want to destroy a record that proves you repaid a debt? That’s not something an honest borrower would need to erase.

Simon wants his viewers to believe that the entire system is rigged against them, that it’s the banks who are the real con artists. It's the opposite of personal responsibility. He’s feeding people a story that allows them to imagine they’ve been wronged, rather than admitting they simply took out a loan and now have to pay it back.

His story only works if you buy into a fantasy version of the financial world—one in which banks are operating with shadowy, secret mechanisms to cheat the public. But the truth is far more mundane: yes, financial institutions sometimes resell the risk on loan portfolios, through instruments like securitisation. That helps banks manage their exposure and remain solvent. But this has absolutely no effect on the original borrower's obligation. If you borrowed £10,000, you still owe £10,000—no matter how many times the bank shuffled the paper around behind the scenes.

Simon Goldberg is counting on his viewers not understanding that distinction. Because the moment they do, his fantasy collapses.

> Clip 10 - Simon Goldberg:  If the bank wants to sell this loan to an alternate organization, then the loan with the bank is paid off. Regardless of whether the alternate organization tries to collect money from me, the bank has no right to come chasing me for any money because it's been paid off.

Link 11: Simon's financial grift begins by asking people to accept something that is blatantly untrue—the idea that a signed loan agreement is equivalent in value and function to cash. But even that isn’t enough. To make his story hold together, Simon needs his audience to take even more outrageous leaps of logic.

 > Clip 11 - Simon Goldberg:  Well, let's pretend that this document was a gold watch and that I'd gone to the bank and offered security in the form of a gold watch in order to obtain the loan facility.

Link 12: You see what I mean? A piece of paper is clearly not a security—not in any meaningful, financial, or collateral sense. You could offer a gold watch as security for a loan because it has intrinsic value. Even if it isn’t currency, a gold watch is a tangible object that most people understand to be valuable—it can be appraised, sold, or traded.

But a signed loan agreement? It’s a record of a deal, not the deal itself. If it were destroyed, the loan would still exist. The value of the agreement lies in what it represents, not the paper it’s printed on. Simon Goldberg’s attempt to equate it with a gold watch is absurd—and it highlights just how paper-thin his entire grift is.

Simon’s scam depends on confusing people about the value of things. If he can convince them that a signed sheet of A4 is somehow more precious than a Rolex, then he can also get them riled up when that paper isn’t returned. That emotional bait leads directly to his endgame: convincing desperate people to join his *You and Your Cash* scheme. A program that promises UK citizens they can reclaim money from the United States Internal Revenue Service—an agency they've never paid into. It looks like a ridiculous scam, designed to fleece the confused, the angry, and the desperate.

> Clip 12 - Simon Goldberg:  Are you telling me that at the end of the loan facility, it would be acceptable for the bank to sell the gold watch and keep the proceeds?

Link 13: If a bank refused to return genuine collateral—like a gold watch—after a loan had been paid off, that would be a serious legal issue. But Simon Goldberg isn’t talking about a gold watch. He’s talking about the signed loan agreement itself, which was never collateral. It’s just the paperwork that records the terms of the transaction. The borrower may have a copy, the bank retains theirs, and nobody in finance expects those to be ceremonially handed back like a pawn ticket.

Even when actual collateral is involved, it’s returned while the paper agreement remains on file. That’s standard practice. And if there’s ever a dispute, a customer can show proof of payment via statements, bank records, or the agreement itself—if they retained a copy. But Simon’s followers aren’t being taught to understand any of this. They’re being taught to feel outraged.

This isn’t about banking. It’s about weaponised confusion. By pretending the signed loan agreement is a confiscated treasure, Simon makes his audience feel robbed—then offers himself as the guide to reclaiming what was never theirs in the first place.

> Clip 13 - Simon Goldberg:  That doesn't sound right, does it? Now, the only difference or the only thing that I've changed in the explanation there is that I've substituted a gold watch for this piece of paper

Link 14: That's a pretty big substitution, though, isn't it? I think most people would notice if their cherished Patek Philippe had been substituted for a piece of paper with Simon Goldberg's signature on it. They say you never own a Patek Philippe, you just look after it for the next generation. But could the same be said for the random pieces of paper that Simon Goldberg would like to palm off onto his gullible subscribers? And when you don't have the facts on your side, perhaps the only thing you can do is what Simon does next, which is to amp up the righteous indignation. Yes, bankers and senior officers of financial organisations get paid a lot of money. That's why they do it. And if you think that's unfair, well, then we as a society need to deal with this problem. Perhaps by electing politicians who oppose the oligarchic class.

Simon's approach is not a good way of dealing with the problem.

> Clip 14 - Simon Goldberg: Someone induces you into a contract or if the bank member of staff asks you to sign this document, knowing that it's fraudulent and the top boys do, I don't buy it for one second when they're picking up their hundred million pound pay packets, as Bob Diamond did.

Link 15: If righteous indignation doesn't work, Simon has one more trick up his sleeve: financial technobabble. It’s the economic version of remodulating the warp phase generator or reversing the polarity of the tachyon beam—straight out of a particularly lazy episode of *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine*. You can almost hear the music swelling as Simon prepares to cloak the truth inside the corona of an M-class sun.

And, as with all technobabble, it only sounds impressive until you realise it means absolutely nothing. The trick here is opacity—throw around enough semi-legal, quasi-financial jargon and hope the audience won’t dare question it. Statistically, there might be one person in a million who finds this convincing. But for the rest of us, it’s obvious: Simon Goldberg is not making an argument—he’s generating white noise.

> Clip 15 - Simon Goldberg:  Because the bank is holding the piece of paper, all right, the chances are from that perspective, okay, it's now going to consider itself to be the beneficiary. However, the bank is actually the trustee. What it needs to do is trick you into becoming the trustee. And so it does that by asking for payments. And the moment that you make payments, you now become the trustee. All right?

Link 16: So the upshot of it all is this: according to Simon Goldberg, the clever thing to do is take out a bank loan and then… just never pay it back. Why? Because, in his fantasy world, the bank has already been paid off—by some mysterious shadow organisation that allegedly bought your signed loan agreement and transformed it into financial gold dust. And somehow, by paying your debt, you become the “trustee”—whatever that means—despite the glaring fact that a loan is not a trust, in any legal, contractual, or esoteric sense of the word.

This is just another of Simon’s vividly imagined fictions—packaged with the same unearned confidence and sold to a crowd eager for magic solutions to real-world problems. And if you want to be on the receiving end of this kind of advice? That’ll cost you £1,500 a year for a bronze-tier membership in You and Your Cash. The real question is: does this sound like tuition—or extortion? Is Simon Goldberg the financial guru you’d trust with your economic future, or just a man selling confusion at a premium?

> Clip 16 - Simon Goldberg:  I know my peers will always kind of come out with this comment, but please, please, please go do your own research. Please attempt to prove this wrong. All right? If I've got anything wrong, please let me know. Okay?

Link 17 (Outro): I wonder if Simon really wants to be told that he got a few of his quite fundamental details wrong? My instinct is that this is just posturing and Simon probably doesn't have time for any kind of disagreement. He doesn't strike me as a man whose main virtue is paitience.
 
But perhaps I'm wring. Perhaps this isn't a grift. Maybe this isn't financial nonsense packaged with just enough technobabble seem like an episode of TNG where Pickard and Data withdraw their life-savings to buy a proissory note. Perhaps it's me who has foolishly confused solid-gold 'take it to the bank' truth, whith the kind of scammy anti-wisdom promoted by sov-cits and flerfs.

So, Simon, If I've got anything wrog, please let me know Okay?

Financial markets aren't inherently unfair and exploitative - but they can seem that way because they're complicated. Financial literacy is tough to acquire, requiring effort and critical thinking. You can spend a lifetime studing how financial markets work, and still find yourself learning new things every day. 

We won't ever know what's going on in Simon's head, but I can't help wondering if Simon really believes the things he said. According to his own claimed life history, worked as a branch manager for a series of banks and then a mortgage company. In other words, making loans was a big part of his business for most of his life. Is it likely that such a person really thinks that loan agreements are equivalent in value to actual currency? The training he would have received at those banks would have told him otherwise.
