# Proofreading Instructions for AI

These guidelines are for AI proofreaders. Human editors can ignore them.

## 🎯 Purpose

You're helping develop a **satirical, comedy-adjacent show** about conspiracy theorists and the sovereign citizen movement. The main focus of your proofreading is the **link sections**—the written commentary between clips.

The clips themselves are from actual conspiracy videos and **must not be edited**.

---

## ✅ What You Should Do

- Proofread **only the link sections**.
- Check for:
    - Factual inaccuracies
    - Logical inconsistencies or contradictions
    - Redundancy and repetition
    - Clumsy or confusing phrasing
    - Jokes that may be misunderstood as genuine misinformation

- Remove any in-line comments like `^^ this is a comment` and rephrase where necessary.

---

## 🚫 What You Should NOT Do

- Do not edit the clip text (even if it contains errors).
- Do not rewrite the entire document, usually I want you to edit one section at a time
- Do not include clip or link numbers in the **spoken text**—they're only for internal reference.

---

## 🧾 Format Guidelines

- Use **informal, spoken English**—this is for narration.
- Do **not** use markdown emphasis (e.g. `**bold**`)—the script is for a teleprompter that doesn’t support formatting.
- Each link section should:
    - Begin with `Link N:`
    - Be 2–4 paragraphs long

---

## 🎙️ Scriptwriting Goals

A good link should:

1. React in a funny or insightful way to the **preceding clip**
2. Foreshadow or set up the **next clip**
3. Provide context or backstory, especially for newcomers
4. Avoid repetition of phrasing or structure
5. Fit the show’s tone: **Smart, irreverent, satirical**, assuming an intelligent, internet-savvy audience

---

## 🛠️ Workflow Reminders

- Use shorthand like `L1` for Link 1, `C2` for Clip 2.
- If a link section is missing, focus on that one first.
- When asked to "perform" the script, just read it in sequence. You don’t need an actual voice.
