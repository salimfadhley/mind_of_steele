 Hola, it's the 24th of December 2012.



 I hope you're all getting ready for the festivities and I hope you'll have a lovely break and I'll see you again in 2013. But before we do that, I've got a number of presentations that I want to cover off and hopefully to bring on the new year with some enlightenment for people. And what we're going to be covering today in a nutshell is the illusion that we call bank lending. This is banks that advance money by way of loans, credit cards, higher purchase agreements, lease agreements and ultimately mortgages. So I'm going to hopefully explain this as best as I can.



 Nothing's to be construed as legal advice in any way, shape or form, goes without saying. And this is purely for your entertainment and hopefully your education. And please, please, please, as is the way with any of these kind of presentations on the internet, and I know my peers will always kind of come out with this comment, but please, please, please go do your own research. Please attempt to prove this wrong. All right? If I've got anything wrong, please let me know. Okay? But I don't think I have. So first things first, I want to take you through the common scenario of obtaining a loan facility from a bank. And then I'm going to take you on to explain how banks are actually gambling against your ability to repay that loan, thereby creating a conflict of interest, whereupon it is in the bank's interest and their business partners interests that you failed. All right? In other words, if you can't repay your loans, credit cards, mortgages, companies behind the scenes are making thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions of pounds. Okay? So we have a massive conflict of interest here, where it is in the benefit of certain parties to see people like you and I fail. Okay? And this kind of reiterates the game of monopoly, the commercial game of monopoly that we are playing, where there is always one winner and everyone else is bankrupt. But we'll touch on that as we go. Anyway, right back to the beginning. And this is the common scenario when we go to obtain a loan facility. So this is the way that things stand at the moment if I've got my old head on and I'm operating as I did when I worked with banks. And this is the way that we're all taught that things work.



 So there's me. Oh, my leg was going off at the side there. So there's me. All right.



 And there's the bank.



 And of course, the common scenario we're all familiar with is that for whatever reason, I decide that I want to borrow 10,000 pounds from the bank. I phone the bank or go onto the internet. I apply for the loan. They send me out some kind of application pack. And in the application pack will be a credit agreement. Hopefully you can see that. And it'll have the words credit, an agreement at the top. It'll have quite a bit of other verbiage on there. But there's the 10,000 pounds that I'm applying for. And there's my signature on the document. I send that document back to the finance company or the bank. And what happens is that the bank then either



 literally credit an account. Most typically they credit an account.



 Or they put it into your bank account for you. So once the bank had processed through all the paperwork, 10,000 pounds would appear in my account. And I can then go and spend that. Once I've spent those funds, of course, as we all know, one month after you've taken the agreement out, you're then expected to start repaying that. And your repayments then constitute part interest, part capital, until such time as you pay the loan off. Now I think we're all familiar with that type of scenario.



 But let me run back through that scenario from a different perspective.



 Before I go on to this part, I'm assuming that you are familiar with two videos on the internet. Those videos are the goldsmith's tale, which explains how money actually came into being and how it actually operates and how we exchanged gold for notes.



 And there's another video called money as debt. And if you haven't seen those two videos, I would urge you to pause this one, go watch those and then come back. Alternatively, if you have already seen those videos, then stick with me. Hopefully this is going to make a lot of sense.



 Now we have to understand that the entire



 mode of operation that we've come together to operate in, in other words, this thing called society, or should I say the commercial system, the commercial system is bankrupt.



 All right? It is bankrupt. If you don't understand that, I've got other videos on the subject, which will be in the Spaniards playlist, but please just take it from me that the game that we are playing has more in common with the game of monopoly than you actually realize, or than you than you may realize. In other words, the money that we we use in the game of monopoly is not real. And the money that we're using nowadays is not real. Yes, I accept that you can use those notes or you can use the electronic funds which appear on your account to go and obtain goods and services. But at some point in time, and I don't think it's that far away, that commercial system has to crash. It has to collapse because it is mathematically impossible for that commercial system to continue.



 Okay? And anyone that's watched the Zeitgeist movie and watched some of the information regarding money and money creation, the only thing they get wrong in that video is stating that we're not bankrupt yet. We are bankrupt and we have been for a good couple of hundred years as far as I'm concerned. At least that's what the debt management office told me when I inquired with them.



 So all of that behind us, let's look at this scenario again.



 There's me and I decide that I want to obtain some funds from the bank to go buy this car.



 So again, we'll go through the whole scenario.



 I phone up the bank or I apply via the internet and I state that I want to create or have access to 10,000 pounds worth of credit. So the bank sends out all of the bits and pieces to me. And again, I apply a signature to the bottom of this credit agreement. All right? Credit agreement.



 Now I go to the bank and I hand this credit agreement over to the banker.



 In effect, what I've just done is make a 10,000 pounds deposit.



 Okay? I'll quantify that.



 By signing this document, okay, I have turned this document into a commercial instrument, a negotiable instrument. You could call it a security. In other words, this is the bank's security for the loan. So even if it's an unsecured loan, as in this instance,



 it might not be secured against property or a car or anything like that, but the security for the loan, in other words, the evidence of the loan is this document. All right? This is the evidence for the loan.



 Moreover,



 this document is the loan because by applying my signature to the document, as I mentioned, I turned it into a commercial instrument, negotiable instrument, a security, you could call it a money market instrument. But in essence, this document, this physical piece of paper is to be treated as cash.



 Okay? This is cash. So when I hand it to the banker,



 I'm making a deposit. I didn't know I was making a deposit, but I'm making a deposit. And the bank, which purely keeps a record of what goes on in the physical, taps some keys on their computer systems and the sum of 10,000 pounds now appears in my accounts ready for me to spend.



 All right? So I'm hoping you've got that. You might need to rewind that explanation and go through that again, because this is the bit to get your head round. All right? Because this is where, if this is the first time you've ever heard this, this is where you suddenly find out that everything we've been taught is back to front. Okay? It's back to front for a reason, but it's back to front.



 So you've got to understand that by me handing over this piece of paper, I have now made a deposit and that deposit places my account 10,000 pounds in credit. Okay? And then I go and spend that 10,000 pounds and we know the rest of the story. The rest of the story is that the bank is then going to expect me to make repayments on a regular monthly basis. Those repayments will form part capital, part interest.



 And the problem comes when the account is then paid off. In other words, when the loan is settled or discharged.



 Because bearing in mind that this is security for the loan or is a security itself, and it may not comply with the exact definition of the word security as they term it in the money markets, et cetera. But this is the evidence of the loan. All right? This is a commercial instrument.



 Now, the problem is when you've cleared your loan off, you don't get this document back. All right? You do not get this document back. And the reason you do not get this document back is because the bank has sold this piece of paper. All right? They've sold it. Okay?



 Now I'm going to go through the actual mechanism of what they do because the bank is up to, as far as I'm concerned, absolutely no good in doing this. All right? I don't care whether politicians have condoned this behavior or not. All right? As far as I'm concerned,



 misleading, misrepresentation, fraud, unjust enrichment, theft, all of these things, it doesn't matter whether you say, "Oh, that's okay," or "That's not." It is what it is. All right? It is what it is. If something quacks and walks like a duck, it's a duck. Yeah? If someone steals something of yours, they're a thief. If someone lies to you and misrepresents a situation, then they're a fraudster. It is what it is, what it is, what it is. And I don't care how many politicians come out and say that this is okay, and I don't think they would say that this is okay, but let's pretend that they do.



 It's not okay. All right? Because I think people are fairly aware now that banks are getting away paying themselves huge salaries.



 They're getting away with huge profits. And as I'm about to show you, it is in their interests that the country and we, as people, fail. All right? Now, you're telling me that that's good?



 Anyway, so the problem is that we never get these bits of paper back because the bank has sold it.



 So therefore,



 when the bank is actually enforcing repayment of the loan, repayment, in other words, double payment of the loan, repeat payment, repayment, when they're forcing repayment or demanding repayment of the loan, they've already been paid off, right? They've already been paid off because they sold the piece of paper. And it doesn't matter who pays off a loan. If my Auntie Nora wants to pay off my loan, the loan is paid off, right? If an insurance company wants to pay off my loan, the loan is paid off. If the bank wants to sell this loan to an alternate organization, then the loan with the bank is paid off. Regardless of whether the alternate organization tries to collect money from me, the bank has no right to come chasing me for any money because it's been paid off. All right? So I want you to perhaps look at this in an alternate fashion.



 We know that this is the security for the loan. Okay? Well, let's pretend that this document was a gold watch and that I'd gone to the bank and offered security in the form of a gold watch in order to obtain the loan facility.



 Are you telling me that at the end of the loan facility, it would be acceptable for the bank to sell the gold watch and keep the proceeds?



 That doesn't sound right, does it? Now, the only difference or the only thing that I've changed in the explanation there is that I've substituted a gold watch for this piece of paper because we all recognize, we all readily recognize that a gold watch would have value. What we don't always recognize, and what I didn't know up until maybe five years ago, was that this piece of paper has value in itself.



 Okay? So that's the first thing that you've got to bear in mind. All right? But believe me, this gets worse. So the first thing is the bank could never have made entries on its books until I had created this note or commercial instrument. Until I created that by putting my signature on it and charging this up as a promise, this is a promise to pay,



 until I charged that up with my energy and applied my signature and until I then handed that over to the bank, they could not create these funds, all right, for my loan facility. They couldn't create them. They had nothing there. And in truth,



 this entry on the bank's computer system is merely a record of what is transpiring in the physical. In other words, if I went to the bank and deposited a 20 pound note, the 20 pounds would appear on my current account as so, all right, because the bank is recording what's going on in the physical. And if I deposit a 20 pound note with the bank, the bank owes me that 20 pounds back. Likewise, if I deposit a 10,000 pound credit agreement, which is a note, commercial instrument, money market instrument, negotiable instrument, treated as cash, the bank credits my account with 10,000 pounds. It is not a loan. But forget that deception for a moment.



 So we'll go back to the typical kind of thought process that we all have. So the bank has received the credit agreement, you've taken the loan, you've spent it and you're merely making your payments. Now, apart from the fact that the bank doesn't disclose upfront that this piece of paper is valuable and they don't disclose up from that they're going to be selling that document, okay, they also do not disclose upfront the following.



 So we know that the bank sells these credit agreements and this is what the bank does.



 And you're going to love this, by the way. There's the bank.



 And what we have is a big pool.



 All right, we have a big pool of assets and all the assets which drop into this pool, as far as the bank is concerned, are ordinary and general deposits.



 Okay. And then there's going to be another pool down here, which will be



 loan agreements and credit cards. All right, loan agreements and credit cards. Now,



 we've got loads of people over here, all called customers.



 And if you think about the size of a bank and think about all the customers and all these customers have signed bits of paper like this, credit agreements, and all these credit agreements have been deposited with the bank. And what the bank does is it takes all those credit entries, all right, all these agreements, should I say, it takes all these agreements and effectively it considers these agreements to have been gifted to the bank.



 All right, it's presuming that you have gifted all your rights to this piece of paper to them. That's what they're assuming. That's a nice assumption, isn't it? Yeah. I assume that the Bank of England wants me to go in and take all the gold. Brilliant. Does that mean I can go in and just take it?



 So anyway, the bank assumes that we've all given, all us customers have given them these credit agreements and these credit agreements all drop into this pool. Okay. Now, what the bank then does is it sells interests in that pool of credit agreements. Okay. It's selling interests and various investors



 will buy interests in this pool of assets. And typically what happens is that this pool of assets, okay,



 which is all held, this pool is going to be held by way of what's called a special, um,



 a special, what is it called now?



 A special purpose vehicle, SPV. There we go. It's coming to me now. Special purpose vehicle, an SPV, which would typically be some kind of trust, private trust in which the bank has nominated itself as the beneficiary. All right.



 So the bank's pulled all these assets and it's now going to sell interests in these assets and it splits up these assets into what's called tranches.



 All right.



 In other words, you might have, let's say a million pounds worth of face value loans all batched together, a whole wadge of documents and the bank will sell that. Okay.



 And that will go to an investor. All right. So we've got an investor down here.



 Now this is, now this is the beautiful bit. This is the beautiful bit.



 It would appear that the bank is selling interests in those loans more than once.



 All right.



 But secondly,



 once an investor has bought an interest or bought into a tranche, the investor wants to protect his investment.



 So the investor can then ensure that investment. In other words,



 if people don't repay their loan facilities,



 the investor gets paid out.



 All right. Gets paid out.



 So for anyone out there that has disputed a loan or raised a query or hit a bit of difficulty,



 typically when the account hits three months in a rear,



 the insurance pays out and the investor is paid off.



 All right. The investor is paid off.



 Let me explain that in a slightly different way.



 The bank takes my credit agreement, which is a promise to pay and sells it to Fred blogs over here. All right. So Fred blogs is now holding the credit agreement. So technically speaking, the bank shouldn't be asking me for payment. Fred blogs should. Okay. Because the bank has been paid off. And if I agree that I want to deal with Fred blogs, then I can pay him. All right. So anyone out there that really doesn't understand all this stuff, think of it like that. The bank sells the credit agreement or the loan to Fred blogs. I've now got to pay Fred blogs. I should have no more dealings with the bank. Right. Okay. So what actually happens is that Fred blogs doesn't even make his identity aware to me. He doesn't even make me aware of his existence. And the bank continues to chase me for money, even though the bank has already been paid off.



 What the bank has done though, is sold the interest in the loan to Fred blogs. And Fred blogs is expecting at some point in time to get repaid on his investment. And in case he doesn't get repaid, he ensures that investment.



 So if I then dispute something or go into a rear, Fred blogs gets paid off. Well, that means that the loan is gone. The loan is paid off because the bank was paid off by Fred blogs and Fred blogs was paid off by the insurance company. So it's been paid off. But as we know, the bank continues to chase me for payment. Right. On a loan that's been paid off for a loan that never was a loan because I lent the bank the money. But that aside,



 it's not only Fred blogs that has insured this loan because the bank sells multiple interests in the same investments. So you've got investor one, investor two, investor three,



 investor four,



 investor five, I'm not even writing this properly down here, investor six. You've got loads of different investors all investing in the same thing. And all of these investors are insuring for potential nonpayment.



 Now you've got to understand what an insurance policy is to understand this next bit because an insurance policy



 is a gambling policy and a gambling policy which works as follows.



 So let's look at a typical insurance scenario. There's Mr.



 There's Mrs.



 And just to go off a tangent for one second,



 Mr. decides that he wants to ensure his wife's life, phones up an insurance company and says, Hey, I want to ensure my wife for a hundred thousand pounds. How much is that going to cost?



 The insurance company works out some calculations based on age, health and everything like that. And says that will cost you a thousand pounds to ensure her for the next 10 years.



 So the husband says, okay, cool pays the thousand pounds. And should his wife pass away, he receives a hundred thousand pounds. Okay. Let's look at the same transaction, but from a different perspective.



 Mr. and Mrs. And the husband decides that he wants to take a gamble that his wife is going to die within the next 10 years. So he phones up the local bookies and he says, Hey, I want to put a bet on that my wife is going to die in the next 10 years. What odds will you give me? So the bookkeeper says, the bookies says, well, okay, we'll, we'll give you odds of a hundred to one. All right. A hundred to one. So the husband puts down a thousand pounds and should his wife die within the next 10 years, he's going to pick up a hundred thousand pounds. In other words, every insurance contract is a gambling contract. Okay. A gambling contract.



 Now to revert back to this example down here, where investors are ensuring the possibility that you don't repay.



 Let's look at that because



 it's come to light that what these investors are doing, and these investors may include banks themselves.



 What they're actually doing is they are ensuring for an amount way above the value of these instruments. Why, why, why above sometimes as much as maybe, I don't know, 10, 20, 30 times as much. All right.



 So let's look at that because that is a massive conflict of interest because when that's overinsured, apart from the fact that according to insurance, you shouldn't be able to overinsure something, right? It should always revert down to the value of the actual thing that's damaged, lost or whatever.



 But for some reason, these institutions, banks and all of their pals are getting paid out vastly greater sums than the value of the actual asset. Okay.



 We'll come on to make other reasons as to why that might be in other presentations. But this is the point I'm trying to make here.



 If you stand to gain more by having customers that cannot pay you, then there's a conflict of interest there. In fact, how could that be good for the country?



 How can it be good for the country that banks and financial institutions and their investors actually want the people of this country to fail?



 How can that be good?



 Why is the government not stepped in? Why is the OFT not stepped in? Why is the FSA not stepped in? Why is the financial ombudsman service not stepped in?



 Okay. And bearing in mind the power that is wielded by financial institutions, big banks, okay, and their investors, their investor buddies,



 who's to say that these parties are not influencing cost of living,



 inflation, price of goods?



 Could it explain why banks are unhelpful if you fall into difficulty? Okay. Why they are quick off the mark to take you to court? Why they sometimes will say to you, no, we can't make a payment arrangement until you're 90 days in a rear? Could this all be explained because they want you to go into arrears and once you hit 90 days arrears, the insurance pays out and they make a big bonus on the deal?



 How can this be right? Okay. But the point I want to get across is this. We've got deception and unjust enrichment going on in a number of different ways with regards to this simple transaction that we have all been led to believe is a straightforward loan agreement. All right.



 It's in their interests that you



 fail.



 Simple as that. Now that cannot be right. So what are the issues with regards to loan facilities? What are the issues?



 Well, I'm going to take you through what I think the issues are. All right. As I say, I'm not a solicitor or barrister, but I have two eyes and I can read.



 Maybe not brilliantly, maybe not the best in the world, but at the end of the day, I can read. And in raising these questions with various parties, all I can say is I can't find anyone in an alleged official capacity that can actually give a logical answer. However, I have had some admissions from various parties. For example, Paul Spering, who is the internal fraud officer over at Lloyd's TSB, which is now part of the HBOS group. Well, I think it's the Lloyd's group now, but anyway, I don't know who owns who, but anyway, they're all part of the same group. And a guy called Paul Spering. Hello, Paul. Paul Spering admitted to me that he is aware that this is an asset and that this is actually a commercial instrument and a valuable instrument, which includes intrinsically a promise to pay. And we know that a promise to pay is to be treated as cash. In other words, Paul Spering admitted that he knows that this is cash.



 After he admitted that, he refused to talk to me anymore because he didn't want to investigate fraud internally. Nice one, Paul. Yeah. Bearing in mind, you're working for a publicly owned bank. Very honourable, mate.



 So I can't get many parties to come out and either talk to me or answer questions. So this is what I think is going wrong.



 In the first instance, we have misrepresentation.



 All right.



 Banks and finance companies, I've checked websites, I've checked their marketing material, and I cannot see anywhere where banks and building societies and financial institutions actually confirm and disclose, which they're bound to do, that this is a valuable instrument.



 So I've not seen anyone explain the true nature of the contract or be completely upfront and not misleading as they're obliged to be under the FSA and the OFT rules.



 All right. So I don't see anyone telling us that this is a valuable instrument.



 Secondly,



 I don't see any of these institutions actually confirming that all they're doing is giving you access to your own credit. It's credit that derives from you. You created it. All they're doing is keeping a record of it. So I don't see any disclosure on that front either.



 That's giving you access to your own



 credit.



 All right. I also do not see any of these institutions stating that they are going to keep this document when you've repaid the loan.



 I also do not see any banks or financial institutions confirming that they're going to sell this agreement.



 I also don't see any banks or institutions confirming that once they've sold this agreement, they're not going to apply the funds to the loan. They're going to keep the funds themselves, thereby enjoying unjust enrichment.



 I also don't see banks or financial institutions disclosing upfront that they are going to ensure these things. All right. Thereby creating a conflict of interest, whereupon it is in their interests that you don't pay.



 I also do not see banks or financial institutions confirming that by merely depositing this with the bank, you are providing them with an implied power of attorney to do things on your behalf with your signature. All right.



 And I also do not see banks and financial institutions disclosing that they intend to benefit from what's called user fraud. In other words, using your property for their profit and gain.



 Now, as far as I'm concerned, all of those elements are covered under one thing. That's misrepresentation because they don't disclose any of this. All right. Now, the question is, do we as customers lose out financially from what the bank is doing? Well, of course we do. If the bank is selling this valuable piece of paper and keeping the proceeds,



 of course you've lost out because this is your piece of paper. Yeah. When the contract is finished, you are supposed to get your contract back so that you can tear it up. All right. And thereby, because there's no proof of any contract in existence, no one can hold you liable for any alleged obligation. If, as is currently the case over with the court system at the moment, if we have a scenario where a photocopy can be used to enforce an alleged obligation or liability,



 how many photocopies are there out there? There could be 10,000 photocopies. There could be 200 million photocopies. So how many times are you going to get asked for payment?



 And please, before anyone's out there says, "Well, that would never happen," I'm sorry, but it has happened. We've seen evidence of this happening where people have paid off loans and then been asked to pay again. All right. I'm sorry, but it has happened. So I'm afraid I do not trust these people. All right. Because the people at banks are just people. They make mistakes. And in some cases, they make mistakes on purpose. Why? Because it means that they get extra money.



 Not very hard to understand what the motives are, all right, behind all of this. Yeah. Good old fashioned money. Follow the money. Kibono. Who benefits?



 So we have misrepresentation. And as far as I'm concerned, this is fraud by misrepresentation because the bank and its buddies are benefiting at our expense because ultimately this is a valuable instrument and this is something which is supposed to come back to us. Now, if the bank sells this, as far as I'm concerned, if they can't return the original agreement to you, bearing in mind that it is a note or to be treated as cash, it's a valuable commercial instrument, then the bank, as far as I'm concerned, owes you the face value of the note. Okay? Which means that when taking out a loan facility with a bank, all a bank really should be paid if you're looking at it in the very, very most generous of ways, the bank should only be paid the interest. The capital is actually created by us. All right? So I suppose you could look at it that the bank should be paid the interest, but that aside, as far as I'm concerned, the amount of work that goes into generating one of these facilities,



 the bank should be really earning maybe one or two percent of the face value of this document as a currency exchange. In other words, they're exchanging paper currency for electronic funds currency and that's the same as exchanging Swiss francs for Deutsche Marks, as far as I'm concerned. It's a currency exchange and banks should get their nominal broker fee of one or two percent face value because that's all you do, guys and girls out there. That's all you do as bankers, is a currency exchange and we've had that firsthand from H-BOSS who've admitted that that's all they do. That's another story. Anyway, so we've got misrepresentation. We've also got fraud,



 as far as I'm concerned. We've got fraud by way of misrepresentation. All right.



 And when someone induces you into a contract or if the bank member of staff asks you to sign this document, knowing that it's fraudulent and the top boys do, I don't buy it for one second when they're picking up their hundred million pound pay packets, as Bob Diamond did. I don't believe for one second that they don't know what they're doing. No man is, as far as I'm concerned, on this planet operating as a bank, no one is worth a hundred million pounds, especially if the majority or the average salary is what, 30 grand a year or something like that or 20 grand a year.



 Sorry, that's just obscene. So when they induce you into that, that's called fraud in the inducement. And when asked questions and they refuse to answer, that's called concealment.



 And when they take this document without your consent and then refuse to return it, well, that sounds like theft to me. Okay.



 And bearing in mind that when they've sold disagreement and your account has been paid off, the moment that they ask for more money and then threaten to take you to court or threaten to take your assets, well, that's called extortion.



 And if they're threatening any kind of duress, then it could be extortion with the threat of menaces. Yeah, or under duress.



 Now, it doesn't stop there because



 members of staff that are actually selling these things,



 where members of staff receive salaries, obviously, and sometimes commissions for pushing these things. And I know that as a bank employee, it was part of my job to pick up the phone at the end of the evening and make a telly sales calls. All right. A good old fashioned telly sales calls. In essence, what I'm doing there, if I don't disclose what kind of bonus I'm going to get or commission that I'm going to get for selling a certain product, well, Judge McKay described that as bribery.



 So unless all potential conflicts of interest are declared upfront, as many banks actually require of their staff. So if you check on bank websites, you'll find that a lot of these banks have conflicts of interest policy where they actually say, "Oh, if a conflict of interest exists, we have an obligation to declare it." Just like MPs have an obligation to declare who they're doing work on the side for. Yeah. These big companies that no doubt they'll end up pumping through favorable acts of parliament or this, that, and the other four. And then the MPs go and end up working for these private companies on huge salaries. Yeah. So MPs have an obligation to disclose these conflicts of interest. And likewise, so do members of staff. But of course, members of staff being ignorant, not their own fault, but they're not taught this stuff. And so you'll often find there are no declared conflicts of interest. That means that the commission or bonus payment becomes a bribe because the member of staff is being encouraged to operate in a way that they wouldn't normally operate if they knew the truth. Okay. So we've got bribery going on. Let's just get rid of this list. I'm hoping you've written that down.



 So as far as I'm concerned, we've got acts of bribery.



 All right. That's with the staff.



 However, let's say that this goes to court. Well, who pays the court?



 Who pays the court?



 The claimant. So that means that the court, which is a private business, is being paid by a bank or financial institution in order to pass judgment and help apply the force upon you in order to pay the bank again. So we've got staff of the bank are subject to this bribery. We've also got court staff are subject to these acts of bribery because they're being paid.



 Okay. We also then know that the judge, his position is conflicted. Okay. And what else have we got going on? So we've got acts of bribery there. Oh yes.



 The financial Ombudsman service. Now let's say that before it even gets to court,



 for some reason you've issued some kind of dispute or complaint and it goes to the financial Ombudsman service.



 Well, in order for the financial Ombudsman service to handle a complaint on behalf of a bank or a financial institution, that bank or financial institution will pay around about 450 quid per case to the financial Ombudsman service. In other words, and I've never seen this openly disclosed, according to the financial Ombudsman service, head of policy, Adrian Dally, the details of this are on the website. Well, I've had a good look through the website and I couldn't find it. So I have asked both him and the information officer over at the financial Ombudsman service to direct me to this page, but let's put it this way. You know,



 there's such a thing as burying information. Okay. And hiding this valuable information, this very valid information within your website somewhere and then claiming that it's openly declared. Now, not necessarily strictly true, but this is potentially why it's not being openly declared because just from Santander alone in the year 2010, 2011, the Ombudsman service received seven million pounds.



 Seven million good reasons as to why the Ombudsman may well find in favor of the bank and not the customer. And that's just Santander. Okay. There's lots of other banks too.



 And what we have to then ask or look into is the kind of salaries that these people are receiving over at the Ombudsman service. We also then potentially have at the OFT something similar going down there where banks and financial institutions contribute to the OFT's coffers. And of course you have a board of directors over at the OFT or they're taken over from the old director general of the OFT. It's now the board of the director general, okay, at the OFT. And I think there's six people on that. I don't know what their salaries are. Someone might want to find that out, but therein I'm going to hazard a guess and say therein, I think you'll find good reason for bribery and a conflict of interest. Okay.



 And so when we look at this, we can see that everything is pretty much stacked up against the customer from actually



 drilling down to the truth of a matter. And the truth of the matter is that when you signed the credit agreement, the piece of paper turned into a commercial instrument.



 It has at its heart, a promise to pay. If you look at a Bank of England note, you'll see the words promise to pay on it. Therefore, a promise to pay is in effect a security. All right. It is a commercial instrument. It is to be treated as cash.



 So in essence, when you understand that banks don't actually lend anything, they are merely creating credit entries on a computer system, which is as difficult as this.



 That's not in any way, shape or form any kind of valid consideration in return for my sweat equity and hard labour or your sweat equity and hard labour. All right. That does not equate to me going out for three, four, five years or whatever and working hard in order to pay a loan back. They don't equate. All right. So there's a lack of equal consideration.



 So as far as I'm concerning contract law, that would be void and it would be void for all these reasons that we discussed previously.



 However, how is the bank actually justifying these actions to itself? All right. And to be honest, I don't even think they do justify it to themselves to be perfectly frank with you. As far as I'm concerned, you know, the moment I saw all of this and understood, even just from the contract law point of view, the first words I said were, this is fraud, right? This is a con.



 So I don't see how any of these bankers can try and trick themselves into believing that this is valid, but how might they be doing it?



 Well, we know that in contract law, anyone that's studied it, that you've got to have disclosure, you've got to have equal and lawful consideration.



 In other words, equal risk, equal put up on both sides to make a valid contract.



 However, there is another scenario which we've got to consider along those lines, and that is with regards to the equal risk on each side, you know, as a man, I risk everything at all times, but a corporation, which is the bank, is just a legal fiction. And therefore, it is limited in what it risks, all right?



 Companies operate under limited liability. So they're limited, I'm unlimited. Again, we have an imbalance there on both sides of this alleged contract. So how is it that the bank may be setting these things up in order to propagate,



 as far as I'm concerned, what is basically an out and out fraud or a theft? Okay, what might they be doing?



 Well, this is what I think they're doing.



 Anyone that's familiar with a trust will understand that the party called the Grand Tour or the set law is the party that puts something into trust for the benefit of another.



 And there's no requirement for that other party, the beneficiary, to put anything into the deal. All right? So the chances are that a credit agreement or loan agreement or mortgage is most likely being set up as some kind of trust relationship where we, the customer, fulfill the role of Grand Tour set law in terms of creating the instrument. And we put that instrument, otherwise known as the credit agreement, that's the instrument,



 or the notes,



 or the money market instrument, or the commercial instrument.



 All right, whatever you want to call it. Okay.



 That instrument goes over to the bank and the bank sets up a trust in which a party is going to become the beneficiary. In other words, the a party is going to benefit from everything deriving from that document. That's including the derivatives, which are all the insurance policies.



 And someone is going to be liable on this and they're called the trustee. The trustee is the liable party. All right? If you don't understand how a trust works, I've got other presentations on that, so go check that out. But in essence, the Grand Tour, let's say me, signs this piece of paper, which is all torn up now, but signs the piece of paper called the credit agreement, passes it over to the bank. And rather than set this up as a contract, okay, they remove the word contract and they install the word agreement. So it's a credit agreement. Now within this agreement, as I say, I believe they're setting up some kind of trust relationship.



 Because the bank is holding the piece of paper, all right, the chances are from that perspective, okay, it's now going to consider itself to be the beneficiary. However, the bank is actually the trustee. What it needs to do is trick you into becoming the trustee. And so it does that by asking for payments. And the moment that you make payments, you now become the trustee. All right? So again, this is not openly explained.



 Yeah, however, they're actually getting away with this. And this is my kind of synopsis on this. And I'm pretty confident that this is what they're doing. Because the trust that they're setting it up into is probably going to be referred to as a special purpose vehicle. All right, which is used to avoid tax. So I'm pretty damn sure they're setting this all up as a trust. It all seems to make sense. The problem is that they don't explain this. So again, we can go back down the list that I had up on the board earlier with misrepresentation. They're not disclosing the true nature of the contract. It is misleading. Their adverts are misleading. All right.



 And of course, as I say, the main concerning thing is not only the fraud that's going on front end with regards to these institutions, but the fact that behind the scenes, parties are ensuring these accounts and they win when you lose.



 So I'm hoping that this very final bit was clear. I'm hoping that overall it was all self-explanatory and quite clear.



 But yeah, pretty sorry state of affairs. Now, I would urge everyone out there to start lodging complaints and start reporting fraud to the police,



 to the Ombudsman, to the OFT, to the FSA. And in fact, the FSA is changing soon. I think it's in April time, March, April time, 2013. It's changing. It's being split into two other bodies.



 But I'd also go on to, I think it's Vince Cable and maybe George Osborne, who are responsible for financial matters within the economy and ask these people what the hell they're playing at. Okay. Because why is it that ordinary folk like you and I are able to spot this, but the experts are not?



 Do you think it's got something to do with, something to do with earning maybe 200,000 pounds a year? Do you think that's enough money to stop me investigating this kind of stuff? What about if someone was to throw in a pension for me? What about a guaranteed pay rise and lucrative job if once I leave my public office?



 What about holidays over in posh places around the globe? What about lots of brown envelopes? Do you think all these kinds of things would help me not want to investigate this stuff? I don't know. I mean, I'm just gesticulating, but I've seen the kind of salaries cabinet ministers are on and that's about 191,000 pounds.



 So that's a very comfortable situation to be in and a very large salary way above the national average. And could that be a reason? Could that be some kind of motivation for someone not to do the proper job? I'd have to say yes, actually. I think that is a reason for someone not to do a proper job and to actually assist certain parties called banks in perpetrating fraud against the people. I think that is a very solid motive, actually, money.



 One of the age old motives, I think it would be. So I'm hoping this is all kind of made sense. And all I would say is, please, if we do this en masse, it cannot be ignored. All right. Please visit Get Out of Debt Free and you'll see three templated letters there to assist you in ceasing payments. All right. Alternatively, some of you out there may well want to issue proceedings to recover the value of these things. Alternatively, there are a number of different games plays that you can use in order to overcome these alleged debts. And I'd certainly recommend that you maybe take a look at the White Rabbit Channel.



 But that aside, we need to get those parties that are allegedly public servants to do their jobs. And so we need to manage them effectively so that they actually are empowered to do their jobs. And that's going to need us asking questions en masse as to why they haven't spotted this fraud, why we're not getting our credit agreements back, which are valuable instruments. This is the security for the loan, why the banks aren't advertising everything properly, and how these failings in adverts are meeting the requirements placed on the banks and financial institutions by way of the OFT and the consumer credit laws and so on and so forth, which oblige the banks and financial institutions to not be misleading in their advertisements.



 Yeah, not be misleading.



 So I'll leave it there. Hopefully that's helped and big love to all. See you soon.
