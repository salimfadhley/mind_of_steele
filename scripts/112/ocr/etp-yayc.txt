6.
Unforeseen obstacles and delays aside, the Service User should expect to receive a 1099 cheque (the "Cheque") within six (6) months to six (6) months plus the delays lodged with the IRS (internal Revenue Service). The Service Provider may "time" the lodgement of the Service User's claim so as to facilitate the best possible chance of success. Therefore, the Service User should not assume that the claim is lodged immediately upon return of the signed documentation.
7.
In addition to the Fee, the Service User agrees to pay the Service Provider a back-end success fee @ a percentage of the Cheque amount (the "Success Fee") (see point #1 above).
8.
The Service User promises and agrees not to harass or bother either the Service Provider or the Service Facilitator with emails, calls or requests for updates. Breach of this term may result in immediate cancellation of the Service User's claim, WITHOUT a refund of the Fee.
9.
The IRS does operate a tracking system (which was down during COVID-19). Once the IRS service is re-activated, the Service User will be provided with a link. The Service Provider promises and agrees to do everything in his power to effect the speedy processing of the 1099 and the Service Provider and the Service Provider that a Cheque be issued by the IRS, and received by the Service User, on a timely basis.
10.
The Service User accepts that once the 1099 has been lodged with the IRS - the matter is entirely in the hands of the IRS and the IRS will process the 1099 at its own pace, which could take longer than six (6) months as has been experienced with the effects of COVID-19 and global Work from Home initiatives.
11.
The Service User acknowledges that if successful, the Service User will receive a Cheque in $USD. Upon receipt of the Cheque the Service User will send a scan or photo of the Cheque to both simone@empowerthepeople.earth and simon@empowerthepeople.earth. The Service User will then bank the Cheque.
12.
Within sixty (60) of receiving the Cheque and no later than seven (7) days after cashing the Cheque, the Service User promises and agrees to forward a sum equal to the Success Fee (as a percentage of the Cheque) (in Sterling / or Euros) at the prevailing foreign exchange conversion rate as expressed by the Financial Times here: https://markets.ft.com/data/currencies to the Service Facilitator.
13.
The rate of exchange and £amount of the Success Fee is to be agreed by Simone or Simon via email simone@empowerthepeople.earth and simon@empowerthepeople.earth on the day the Service User issues the Success Fee (by cheque or bank transfer - to be agreed with Simone or Simon). The Service Provider reserves the right to agree to receive the Success Fee in $USD or Euros.
14.
If for whatever reason following receipt of the Cheque the Service User fails to honour the agreement herein, the Service User agrees that the Service Provider may take any action deemed necessary and appropriate to collect the Success Fee or may approach the IRS and amend the filings on behalf of the Service User so as to render the Cheque null and void (this being the Service Provider's preferred option).
15.
The Service User undertakes and agrees at no time whatsoever to either identify Paul Muad'Dib (the "Expert"), or to make contact with Paul Muad'Dib (the "Expert"). The Service User agrees that both the Service Facilitator and Service Provider are absolved and discharged from all obligations and the Service User will forfeit the Fee.
16.
Force Majeure: the Service User accepts that external events may prevent both the Service Facilitator and Service Provider from fulfilling the Contract. The Fee covers the costs of the service provided by the Service Facilitator, and the Service Provider's costs and expertise in completing the 1099 forms. In the event the IRS or some other external event prevents completion and fulfilment of the Contract, the Service User forfeits the Fee, but is not liable for the Success Fee.
17.
The Service User agrees to keep all paperwork and communications concerning this agreement and process: strictly private and confidential. The Service User agrees that any violation of confidentiality and or trust will absolve both the Service Facilitator and Service Provider from all obligations that will fall under the Fee (as a Licence). Likewise, any act of dishonour committed by the Service User (as determined by either the Service Facilitator or Service Provider) will absolve both the Service Facilitator and Service Provider of all obligations under the Contract and will result in the Service User forfeiting the Fee.
18.
If the spirit of the Contract and or trust between Service User, Service Facilitator and Service Provider is broken (for any reason), either the Service Facilitator or Service Provider may cancel the Contract and the Service User agrees that the Fee(s) is/are to be forfeited.
19.
By way of emphasis and to repeat: upon receipt of the Cheque the Service User agrees to email a scanned copy of the Cheque to simone@empowerthepeople.earth and simon@empowerthepeople.earth to ensure that the IRS are not unnecessarily chased by the Service Provider (which in itself could result in the Cheque being cancelled by the IRS).
20.

The Service User accepts and agrees that at no time whatsoever will copies of completed tax forms (scanned or otherwise) be retained by, or shared by, the Service User. In the unlikely event that a question arises from the IRS - all inquiries, queries, issues will be referred back to the Service Provider (via the Service Facilitator) for handling.
23.
In taking up this service, the Service User agrees and promises that all present and future claims of this type will only be made/lodged through the Service Facilitator and Service Provider and at no time whatsoever will the Service User seek to either replicate the process, re-engineer the process, try the process himself/herself/themself, and or go elsewhere to have the process completed.
