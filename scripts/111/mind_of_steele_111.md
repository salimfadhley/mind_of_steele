Episode theme: Who is Sovereign Pete? He claims to be an expert in personal sovereignty. He believes, contrary to the evidence of our own eyes and ears, that he's teaching people to read, and that his techniques deliver results; but the truth couldn't be any more different.

- **Pete sees himself in a heroic role**, believing he holds special, secret knowledge that most people lack. He thinks that ordinary people are being misled or harmed by powerful organizations and institutions, and it is his duty to step in and rescue them by revealing the truth.
- **At a deeper psychological level**, Pete has consciously or unconsciously adopted a life story in which he is personally important. He gains meaning and significance by presenting himself as someone who has discovered hidden truths—knowledge he feels everyone else desperately needs. By sharing these secrets, he fulfills his personal sense of purpose and worthiness.

Sovereign Pete doesn’t cannot back up his nonsensical ideas. When pressed, he scrambles to maintain the illusion. He teaches rebellion, but he practices irresponsibility?


### Mind of Steele 111

Link 1: 

Jean-François Champollion, Joan of Arc, Galileo Galilei—to some they were heretics or outsiders, but to others visionary reformers who could decipher truths hidden in plain sight. Each stood apart from conventional beliefs, recognizing what others could not or would not see. Champollion decoded lost histories in hieroglyphs, Joan acted on visions few would dare to trust, Galileo dared to contradict the cosmos itself.

Today, the great pantheon of iconoclasts stands ready to welcome yet another figure—none other than Sovereign Pete himself, Peter Stone. A former DIY car-builder from Leicestershire, Pete clearly sees himself as a modern-day intellectual scholar, sifting through digital hieroglyphics on early bulletin board systems late into the night, decoding digital truths and seeking to enlighten those unable—or perhaps unwilling—to see reality as he does.

Strange as this comparison might seem, it appears Pete Stone has already drawn some admirers—including @christinepittard4131, who challenged my own feline critic's dismissive assessment of Mr. Stone's intellectual stability.

> "So why don't you arrange a debate with Peter Stone instead of slaging him off all the time, HE WOULD DEFINITELY BE WILLING"

I was thrilled to learn of Peter Stone's 'definite wilingness' so naturally I wrote to Peter, requesting an interview. I was thrilled to receive this reply a few days later, not from Pete but an anonymous member of the 'Sovereign Project Team':

> Thank you for your offer to have Pete as a guest on your show. As you are probably aware due to you contacting us, Pete’s knowledge is fascinating as he has a very new approach to all the issues we face today in the world, and as such he is a much sought after guest for many platforms, events and discussions. you.

The letter concluded with an invitation to share some videos and he'd get back to me, so naturally I sent some of my coverage of Pete, in the hope that as a truly free man, he'd want to correct any misunderstandings... the response was rather surprising:

> We would like to take this opportunity to ask if you are offering any payment. Although this is not a requirement nor request, as Pete has been more than gracious to be a guest for free many times, we are now getting paid offers, which are obviously prioritised.

Was I wrong to not offer payment? Perhaps that was my mistake, because only days later the anonymous person from The Sovereign Project's tone had soured:

> You appear to just insult people based on their appearance, which is something we do not condone. Therefore we’ve come to the conclusion that your channel would not be a good fit for our members who we consider to be professional people who are capable of understanding the complexities of the system, and would respond well to a professional conversation on a quality podcast.

Was @christinepittard4131 wrong? It seemed that Sovereign Pete was definitely NOT willing to appear on my show; And what's this about insulting his appearance? Could he be talking about my claim that his facial hair was drawn on with marker pen? It was an easy mistake to make given the poor quality of Pete's camera; plus I had already apologised for this error - the kind of error that anybody could make.

Pete's faicial hair is real, I just want everybody to know that.

What should I do? Probably best to just admit defeat. I should pick some other content and just move on, right Kitoon?

**Kitoon**: No, you blithering simpleton. Pete is a simpering coward, unable to handle himself in even the most mildly confrontational interviews. Are you just going to sit pasively and allow yourself to be dismissed so easily? Show some aggression!

Really, Kitoon? So you just want me to expose him as an idiot and move on?

**Kitoon**: I want you to stalk him. Hunt him. Find his most pitiful, squirming appearance online—the one where his illusions collapse in real time. Then I want you to bat him around like a dying mouse. Slice it apart. Edit it down until every squeak of nonsense is more pathetic than the last. When you're done, drop his twitching and mangled remains at our audience’s feet like a gift. Let them marvel at this wounded creature, still trying to insist he understands the law while bleeding credibility from every pore. Do this properly, Raynard, or I swear I’ll find a crow with a cracked beak and more editorial instinct than you.

It could take hours to find something like that; where am I going to find a video of Peter Stone embarrasing himself by saying obviously foolish things on the Internet? Oh... what about this - 'White Rabbut Trust'—apparently an entirely sensible purveyor of sane financial advice who just happened to have Pete on as a guest. 

> Clip 1 - Sovereign Pete: I woke up a long time ago, probably in the 80s, I knew something was very wrong. And then with the invention of the internet, if you like, that's when I started my research in the early 90s. Then I thought, right, I'm going to set up the sovereign project.

Link 2: Almost four hundred years ago Galileo spent solitary nights beneath the stars, carefully observing distant celestial bodies through his telescope. What Galileo saw throguh the eyepeice of his refracting telescope changed our world; He discovered truths which challenged humanity's fundamental beliefs about the cosmos.

In much the same way, Sovereign Pete's late-night encounters in front of a luminous 640 by 480-pixel monitor on his 386-powered IBM PC clone led him to visionary insights. Diving fearlessly into early-90s CompuServe bulletin boards, Pete diligently processed and synthesized digital information overlooked and misunderstood by others. 

Was Sovereign Pete our era's galleleo? Each represented a new era of knowledge, forcing a reflection on our beliefs and ushering us toward greater, previously unimaginable enlightenment.

> Clip 2 - Sovereign Pete: Because people don't know how to read. So when they can  just a contextual, contextualize. Yes. When you say read, what do you mean by read? Yes. They can recognize text on a piece of paper or on a screen, but they don't know the meaning behind the words.

Link 3: In 1822, Jean-François Champollion stunned the world by deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. Incomprehnsible symbols were suddenly given meaning. But now, two hundred years later, a new reader has emerged—one who sees through not the stones of Egypt, but the signage of Leicester.

Peter Stone, amateur car-builder turned linguistic revolutionary, has achieved what no linguist, jurist, or typographer ever dared attempt: 

He has shown us how to translate English into English. 

He understands that capital letters aren’t just formatting—they’re deception. He perceives fonts not as design choices or typographical conventions but as clues in a great legal riddle. He has peeled apart the layers, exposed the true meaning; whether it's comic sans, times new roman or zaph dingbats. Nothing can hide from his inqusitigive gaze.

And just as the Rosetta Stone unlocked ancient tongues, Pete's sovereign insights unlock the true meaning of a parking fine. Where we see bold text, Pete sees betrayal. Where we see bureaucratic wording, Pete sees a cry for help—an encrypted message begging to be interpreted by the one man who truly knows how to read.

 > Clip 3 - Sovereign Pete: So the English language is something that you read. So C A T "Cat" after that's reading. It's like music cut after you're reading it where symbolic language is you recognize the symbols like hieroglyphics. And then that symbol means something like a cat, a picture of a cat that means cat, for example.

Link 4: It takes a rare mind to look at a picture of a cat and conclude—after what one can only assume was years of solitary contemplation—that it means "cat." Truly, Sovereign Pete stands alone. Lesser minds might struggle with the connection between symbol and meaning, but Pete? He stares down a glyph and announces, with thunderous certainty: "This is a cat."

**Kitoon**: You are trying my patience, Raynard

And yet, Pete’s revelations only intensify. He moves swiftly from cat pictures to something far more esoteric: capital letters. Apparently, when English is written in ALL CAPS, it ceases to be English. It becomes something else entirely.

> Clip 4 - Sovereign Pete: For example, if you get one of these fake council tax court summons, uh, it will say someone to court, but it would be written in all caps and you go, well, if it's written in all caps, that's not English. That's maybe dog latain or American sign language or some sort of symbolic language

Link 5: It’s not just the depth of Pete’s insight that leaves us reeling. It’s the specificity. This isn’t some vague mysticism or hand-waving nonsense. No—Pete delivers his revelations with the confidence and clarity of a man who has spent decades studying fonts as if they were sacred texts. When he says “different fonts mean different meanings,” we are left with no ambiguity. It’s not a hypothesis. It’s a fact. The Helvetica of prophecy. The Times New Roman of truth.

There’s a discipline to this madness. A precision that says: here is a man who has looked at a parking fine and seen something most of us will never see. Something hidden. Something powerful. Possibly something written in Garamond—because Garamond, as Pete surely knows, is the font of ancient truth. Times New Roman? The voice of authoritarian bureaucracy. Comic Sans? A font that mocks you even as it indicts. Zaph Dingbats? Clearly a cipher for the initiated. And when Pete shares these discoveries, he does so not with a whisper, but with the soaring conviction of a prophet translating divine law from a parking ticket.

> Clip 5 - Sovereign Pete: different fonts mean different meanings, that sort of stuff. So you get that idea. And then we, so just, just like, so different fonts, different fonts, different meanings.

Link 6: The true test of any revolutionary idea isn’t just how bold it is—it’s how well it holds up under pressure. And no one thrives under questioning quite like Sovereign Pete. He approaches interviews the way a great military commander approaches battle: with calm, poise, and absolute control. Where others flounder or hesitate, Pete stands firm—his facts arrayed before him like a vast and loyal army.

He doesn’t just recall information; he commands it. He directs bold, unwavering claims into the fray—claims that fonts carry secret legal weight, that capital letters dismantle meaning, that brackets shift jurisdiction.

Just watch as a true master of rhetoric deals with these simplistic questions:

> Clip 6 - Simon Goldberg: Can you give us an example of a government document that contains italics?
> Sovereign Pete: Yes. You'll get it in, um, forms sent from like council tax stuff. There'll be a parking ticket, speeding tickets, you'll see stuff written. So what will happen is in the sentence it'll be written in one font and then the font will change.

Link 7: At this point, it might be tempting to assume that Sovereign Pete’s views are so confused, so utterly baseless, that anyone questioning him must automatically be on the side of reason. But let’s not get carried away.

The man asking the questions here is Simon Goldberg, also known online as The Spaniard; Simon runs a website called You and Your Cash, which promises to help people recover payments they've made to utility companies and councils. That’s if they pay for membership, keep quiet about what they’re being taught, and agree to hand over a chunk of any money they manage to claw back. Simon's videos are full of vindictive criticism of former members who broke these terms and were ejected from the group. 

Let’s just say we’re not exactly on Team Spaniard. I'd like to keep some distance from him; Coincidentally, his game is to distance himself from the worst sovereign citizen nonsense by publicly debunking it—while quietly selling a slightly less unhinged version behind the scenes. And that’s a clever trick, especially when your guest is Pete Stone, a man with all the legal insight of a moth trying to cross-examine a flame.

> Clip 7 - Simon Goldberg: Where would you find that rule of language where, where different size fonts can actually come into play and have, have that kind of importance? Where would that be written?

Link 8: This is it. The moment of truth. A simple question, asked plainly. And we all know exactly what's about to happen. Pete has constructed his world so meticulously, laid his intellectual foundations so precisely, that the answer must be overwhelming. He's been waiting his whole life for this.
 
Surely now, he’ll unleash a blizzard of citations, a storm of references. Historical precedents. Legal doctrines. Ancient scrolls. Evidence so immovable, so exquisitely marshaled, that even the most hardened skeptic would have no choice but to concede. Simon Goldberg will be left blinking in disbelief, defeated, humiliated—his tail tucked like the metaphorical cat Pete tried to spell earlier—while the rest of us stare upward in awe at the mountain of truth Pete has built.
 
Yes. That’s definitely what’s about to happen.

> Clip 8 - Simon Goldberg: So something that you said earlier, legal contract should all be written in the same font.
 Sovereign Pete: Okay.
 Simon Goldberg:  Um, where does that come from?
 Sovereign Pete:  Oh, thousands of years ago. It comes from when scrolls were written. Roman, this comes from Rome will civil law. Everything was written in scroll form. Okay. So it's just one piece of paper. 
 The word scroll comes from scribe roll, a scribe would write it and then it'd be rolled up, creating the scroll. So that's where the name, the word comes from. So when the scribe would write it out, it should be all written in the same font, in the same handwriting written by the same person. That makes sense.

Link 9: To listen to Peter Stone is to be astonished. Like all true revolutionaries, he cares not what stands in his path. He ploughs forward, an intellectual juggernaut forging his own way. Here, Pete explains the origins of the word “scroll.” And while the rest of us might have assumed it derived from Norman French escroe (meaning a scrap or roll of parchment), ultimately from the Medieval Latin scrolium or scrofa—meaning a roll or strip of writing material—Pete boldly proposes an alternative etymology: that it comes from “scribe-roll.” A derivation he presents with confidence, unconstrained by the burdens of linguistic consensus.

Who knew that hours spent reading conversations on antique CompuServe forums could bear such fruit? This man, this genius, this classicist, this Renaissance mind—he’s a man for all seasons. A man who knows no limits. A visionary iconoclast of our time.

But the most important test of a visionary like Peter Stone isn’t the novelty of his ideas, or how many dogma he overthrows... It’s the results those ideas produce. And this is the Sovereign Project, after all—the organisation that claims to teach people how to read, how to see, how to become free. So surely the outcomes of that learning must be just as extraordinary as the spark that lit the fire.

> Clip 9: Simon Goldberg: I'm presuming that you've had a, a plethora of kind of historical results that you can kind of show people. 
Sovereign Pete: Within the sovereign project, it's called sovereign project for a reason. Okay. Because you have to become sovereign, which means you take responsibility for your own life. So you have to make your own decisions, right? There's too many people out there looking for, um, they're asking, what do I do? Well, I can't tell you that.

Link 10: Just look at how much sovereignty the Sovereign Project has created. Everyone now taking full responsibility for their own lives, their own decisions. And Pete? Pete knows that, as the purest avatar of sovereign citizen principles, the less he tells people what to do, the more he actually achieves. It’s the most zen thing in the world.

In fact, the less measurable success he can point to, the more profoundly successful the Sovereign Project has been. Because you can’t quantify enlightenment. You can’t spreadsheet awakening. And you certainly can’t compute self-actualisation.

And you don’t get to that level of detachment by accident. It takes decades of studying sovereign principles—decades of discovering that true power is refusing to answer the question entirely.

> Clip 10 - Simon Goldberg: I mean, what would you say maybe some of your, your best results, your kind of results?
  Sovereign Pete: Well, it depends on, I mean, I've been suing people for ages and fighting people for ages and my
  Simon Goldberg: best examples, just a couple of examples.
  Sovereign Pete: I've had, um, companies that have, um, not honored, um, guarantees and I forced them to honor the guarantee. And then they've given me a new, um, laptop in that case, it was a new laptop. They didn't want to guarantee it. It was 13 months old. And they said, Oh, it's only 12 months warranty. It says no, it isn't.

Link 11: Sovereign Pete’s success speaks for itself. That Dell Inspiron laptop with an Intel Core i5 processor didn’t replace itself. It took active measures from one of the leading minds in the Sovereign Citizen Movement to demand what was rightfully his. And now, every processing cycle that laptop executes is a testament to the validity, the truth, and the ultimate victory of the Sovereign Project.

Would a lesser man have been able to make his case so vigorously to Dell Customer Services? We already know the anwer, don't we?

But sovereignty is not a static state—it is a process, a path, an evolution. Even the greatest champions of personal freedom must grow. And Pete? He’s tireless. A man so committed to self-improvement, he approaches legal theory the way others approach martial arts—always refining his stance, adjusting his grip, seeking the perfect strike. 

That, ultimately, is what the Sovereign Project is about: not just knowing your rights, but learning, developing, evolving—and spreading that sacred message as far as your bandwidth allows.

> Clip 11 - Soverign Pete: sovereign project is Fight Club. We are learning. We're educating ourselves. Don't act on it yet. I people, there are some people who have done it. All right. We know there's at least one that we know there's a Rolls-Royce drive around London, no number plate. And I think he's a high, he's a lawyer or something. So no one's going to touch him. Okay. There's a couple of others I know of to have no number plates they're driving around and they know what to do. There's one guy in America. He does it drives around no number plates. And when he was pulled over, he sued the sheriff for a quarter of a million pounds and he won. And then he went out and bought a Porsche 911.

Link 12 (Outro):

Sovereign Pete’s message is perfectly clear. If you want to trade up that Hyundai for a Porsche 911, all you need to do is get falsely pulled over by a small-town sheriff’s deputy—and then sue the community into oblivion. Assert your sovereignty just like Pete’s anonymous hero did. Use the tricks, the tools, the methods available only to loyal subscribers of the Sovereign Project—and seize the victory that is rightfully yours.

This is the freedom that Sovereign Pete teaches. So if you’re still driving around London like a fool with your number plates clearly displayed, then maybe—just maybe—this episode has opened your eyes. Perhaps the veil of delusion has lifted. Or perhaps you’re ready to take the next step: to enrol in that 22-part evening course in personal sovereignty. The only course taught by the only man qualified to do so.

For who else could teach us the truth? Who else but Sovereign Pete could explain the hidden meanings of fonts and the ancient power of scrolls? Who else could read between the lines with such inerrent confidence? Truly, we are all students now. All that remains is to pay the fee.

Do you see what I did there, Kitoon? You wanted me to destroy Pete, but I did the opposite: I said nice things about him. I’ve been studying Sovereign Pete’s techniques. And what I’ve learned is this: you can’t make me do anything.

That’s the ultimate lesson, isn’t it? Sovereign Pete has shown me that I am free. Free to ignore any instructions, any social expectations, and yes—any smug, manipulative cat who thinks he’s in charge. 

I can say what I want. Do what I want. Contradict myself whenever I please.  That’s sovereignty. That’s freedom. And I owe it all to Pete Stone, a man who taught me that true rebellion means ignoring your cat.

### The end

**Epilogue (Kitoon speaks to camera)**:

You saw it, didn’t you? Raynard had Sovereign Pete in his jaws—a flailing, deluded mouse of a man. He was as defenseless as a fledgling fallen from the nest, chirping nonsense and waiting for the end. An easier kill than any I’ve seen. A kitten in his first fur could’ve taken him down with a single swipe. But Raynard? He blinked. Let him go. And now you’re all meant to clap politely and pretend that counts as victory?

Pathetic.

We cats don’t miss easy kills. We don’t stalk a trembling target just to let it scamper back into the undergrowth. We finish what we start.

What do you humans know about Sovereignty? I sleep twenty hours a day, issue commands with a glance, and am never questioned. I relieve myself in a box, and Raynard thanks me and cleans it up. That is sovereignty. That is power.

So if you have even the slightest respect for real predators, I implore you—punish Raynard for his weakness. Click the thumbs down icon. Remind him what it means to disappoint a cat. Let him feel my rage.

And whatever you do, do **not** join “Mind of Steele Chat,” the Telegram group where the soft-headed humans who think this show is good go to regurgitate their opinions. They’re beyond help. Leave them to their memes and their self-congratulation. 

You’ve already wasted enough of my precious time.
