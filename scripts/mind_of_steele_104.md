Interior, man watching a video on a laptop:

Scene 1:

Man attaches 1 star to his lapel \- he looks very proud

Scene 2:

Man attaches a 2nd star to his lapel \- he looks even prouder.

Scene 3:

Man and women, at a bus-shelter

Woman: Why are you wearing two gold stars?

Man: I got it from Mind of Steele, that’s a youtube show about British conspiracy theory culture. You should watch it.

The man shows the woman a mobile phone he’s watching

Woman: (emphatically), No, no \- not for me.

Link 1: Something almost nobody ever asks me \- when will you feature that Banaman on your show again? He makes such interesting videos of carefully thought-out protests. And he always features perfectly sensible guests. 

Isn’t it odd that nobody ever says that to me?

Just as people tend not to say, we demand more Liverpool People’s Resistance. They are so well-adjusted and informed. What our collective consciousness needs right now is extended exposure to those brave and plucky scousers\!

It’s almost as if the two things people don’t want to see on a Monday evening are Banaman and TPR, which is unfortunate because that’s what I’m about to share with you. 

Today, I will share the unfortunate case of Michael Furlong, a sov-cit from Liverpool. It’s hard to say whether he was always completely insane or whether this insanity was brought upon him by his connection to Liverpool TPR, but like a moth drawn to a flame, idiots are drawn to Mark Banaman’s YouTube show. 

It’s almost as if they recognise each other from a great distance \- perhaps one excretes a pheromone that the other inexorably homes in on. However, this magical attraction works what we know is that somehow, they find each other. Over tens, sometimes hundreds of miles, thy flock together. 

Banaman  
TPR  
Moth Joke

Whether it is at a home repossession, a truly incomprehensible protest or a comically insane attempt to citizens-arrest a police officer, somehow Banaman is always there. He always manages to find the most genuinely insane conspiracy theorists and then reveal them at their very worst.

And like all of the best Banaman videos, this one begins with him being confused about something that most adults had figured out before they became adults. 

**That's a warrant. Page one of... One. Very interesting crest. Like I said, they'll have to justify that crest. I'm pretty sure they'll try to. I don't know what it is. I've never seen one before like that. Are they not supposed to be signed?** 

Link 2: That symbol should be instantly recognisable, even to somebody as easily confused as Mark Banner, but because I know some of my audience are fans of the narrative arts, please consider this as foreshadowing. Yes, that emblem and the institution it often adorns will play a significant role in the latter part of this video.

But to sustain a frisson of suspense, I won’t name which organisation. That’s going to ber an exiting surprise. The pent-up excitement will sustain your attention beyond the critical two-minute drop-off. 

But, since this is a Banaman video, that reminds me, I need to issue the customary warning. What you are about to see are some truly wretched individuals. So unless your idea of a good time is watching a bunch of far-right-wing lunatics make elementary errors about the British legal system, then I suggest you immediately click over to this video about reintroducing rescued otters back into their wild habitats.

Lutris lutris, the common or Eurasian otter, is a member of the Mustilidae family which includes weasels, badgers and stoats. But I think we can all agree that otters are the best, most beautiful and graceful creatures.

Sometimes, it beggars belief that we live on a planet of such extremes. In this delicate wetland, we see the common otter, a perfectly adapted aquatic predator. Sleek, beautiful, and buoyant \- Only a few hundred miles away, in this suburb of Liverpool, we encounter the subject of that warrant for — Michel Henry. 

Like the otter, he is also a mammal, unlike in every conceivable way.

**Video footage. Would it be alright to include it? Are the police officers coming to your house? Of course, yeah. I've gone on tired. The whole footage? The whole footage, yeah. I can give you an un-e-d-e-d-evasion if you need it, Mark.**

Link 3: Sometimes, I think Mark Banner, the failed wedding photographer from Sheffield, is trying to do my job for me.

It’s as if he’s recognised that my ‘Unique Selling Point’ is that I make videos highlighting the ridiculousness of the conspiracy theory movement. He decided to undercut me by getting to the most mentally unstable conspiracy theorists and then making videos that perfectly highlighted their lunacy.

That’s what you are going to see today. I had to cut short extracts from Banaman’s video, but the original is a perfect character study of a true cretin. If I’m being honest with you \- my commentary doesn’t really add all that much. 

Banaman released this video, and I wonder if he’s not secretly on my side. The Banaman project is a devilishly clever way to undermine the conspiracy theory movement from within. 

**What's your name? What's your surname? What's your surname?  My name is 5891 based on... Well, that's a corporation\! You've got no business yet, come on.**

4: I could explain what Michael Furlong means. But do you really want to know? If I do, it might spoil the randomness of the whole event for you. You can watch this as a piece of freak-out cinema, something with the logical coherence of 2000 Motels, or one of Alexandro Jodorowsky’s Holy Mountain. 

You can watch this as comedy-adjacent performance art and not a sad glimpse into a mind shattered by the hallucinatory vision of the sovereign-citizen movement. 

If you don’t want to know \- if you don’t want to soil this perfect moment of watching a naked man wrestle with a police officer, just skip 30 seconds, and you can remain in blissful ignorance. You can marvel at the grotesque homo-eroticism of it all without having to trouble your mind with its deeper meaning.

If you are still with me, that means you have chosen the path of knowledge \- but it is also the path of pain. 

**How much you letting yourself... You letting me see what? Where's that business? It's Mr Freling. That's Mr Freling. Michael, are you coming in your bills? 8-1. It's Mr Freling.**

5\. He’s pointing to a copy of his birth certificate and indicating that is the real Michael Furlong. 

Some sovereign citizens like Michael believe that the registration of a child’s birth, the process which culminates in the production of a birth certificate, is a fraudulent transaction which commits a child to a life of indentured servitude by creating a “legal fiction”. 

This “legal fiction” is represented by one’s first and last name and, by typographical convention, is usually written in block capital letters.

What you are about to see will make slightly more sense if you realise that Michael believes the name on his birth certificate refers to a fictional person, Michael Furlong, but is entirely distinct from Michael Furlong, that naked man we’ve just seen wrestle a police officer. 

Consequently, Michael believes himself to be the victim of a terrible injustice. This arrest warrant was issued in the name of Mr. Michael Furlong; however, the person that the police arrested was utterly different and by no means even vaguely related to Mr. Michael Furlong.

**It's Mr Freling. You're just fucking... You're just fucking... I'm on the rest.  Do you understand? You let the fuck happen now\!  I'm still mad. We're going\! We've been calling the chap. We've been out\! Fucking rat\!**

6\. So, to cut this buffoonishly long story short, Michel, the man, and not his birth certificate, was handcuffed and then taken to a nearby police station, where he spent the next fifteen days. Most likely, his stay at His Majesty’s pleasure was extended due to this bizarre and confusing behaviour.

Michael was charged, and then eventually released \- but that is by no means the end of this story. 

**So, today 5891 is claiming what? He's claiming he's now winning the role of Constable, but on the visual, on the visual that you post with George, he kept giving his name, 5891, so he was there in a commercial capacity. The warrants in law, he who makes the claim has the burden of proof, so he's made the claim he had the warrants and I asked him, can I ascertain who's issued the warrants and he repeatedly failed to produce the warrants.**

7\. Remember, a few minutes ago, I foreshadowed something. I told you that the emblem on that paper would be something we’d see again—and there it was.

On the front of the Liverpool’s Crown Court building. 

Wasn’t that clever? Aren’t you proud of me? 

But mostly, aren’t you proud of yourself for committing that image to your memory and then recognising it a few minutes later? 

If the answer is yes, then award yourself a gold star. You deserve it\!

Just look at you, resplendent and gleaming. That star is a testament to your keen attention to detail and commitment to this narrative. 

You earned it\! Wear it with pride.

And if your finely honed instincts for narrative structure haven’t deserted you, ask yourself, what could it all mean? Is Michael finally facing justice for that skyclad scuffle with PC 5981? 

Not if the plucky crack legal team from the Liverpool People’s Resistance have anything to do with it.

**Now, 12 months later, this Asian 5891 was bringing a claim of assault against me, but he wouldn't produce the warrants, he was committing fraud and he was trespassing at the time. He's assaulting me and I'd react to this under the Castle Doctrine.**

8\. Ah, yes, the castle doctrine is the principle in American criminal law that one’s home is one’s inner sanctum. If you say Castle Doctrine in a federal criminal court, just about everybody will understand you as they salute the stars and stripes, say the pledge of allegiance and then go and shoot hoops.

If the new American government one day seeks to annexe Merseyside, perhaps as an unincorporated territory, like Purto Rico…

… then maybe that court we see in the distance will one day resound with jubilant calls of ‘Castle Doctrine’. Alas, the Liverpool People’s Resistance has seen a vision of the future hidden from the rest of us. That court building is subject only to the laws of the United Kingdom.

This is one of those British courts: a drab grey 1970s building creaking under decades of underfunding from a series of caress governments for whom justice was an afterthought. This modernist edifice is as far as you might get from a castle.

But perhaps the castle is in the minds of Liverpool’s people’s resistance. Perhaps the castle was the friends we met along the way, or maybe even the mostly eroded barrier between fact and fiction in the whacky world of these conspiracy theorists. 

**What they're doing at the moment, they've not only not got no authority after the Clearfield Doctrine, they're just doing whatever they want. This is a mafia gang and they need removing.**

9\. Ah yes, the Clearfield Doctrine, a legal principle established in the landmark 1943 US Supreme Court case Clearfield Trust Co vs United States, which established that when the federal government engages in commercial activities—such as issuing negotiable instruments—it is treated as a private party subject to the same rules and liabilities under commercial law.

What brilliant legal minds these Liverpool TPR must be \- can you imagine the sharp intake of breath when Michael’s legal representative explains that arresting him for scuffing with a police officer who was, in turn, requiring him to come into the station to answer some questions because he’d been caught in possession of a large quantity of cannabis, was in fact a violation of the Clearfield doctrine.

Who knew this seemingly hum-drum, clear-cut criminal case would hinge on a civil law principle established 80 years ago in an entirely different continent?

I doubt anybody would be prepared for this 1-2 punch rope-a-dope of justice

**It's also a crime to fund terrorism, so the taxpayer now needs to take a serious off themselves because they're funding the terrorist organisation and in law, ignorance of the law is no excuse, so you will be accused of treason as a secondary offender for paying tax.**

10\. So, if you are paying tax, and your tax revenue is going to fund the police and the courts, then you are an accessory to the crime of terrorism.

This is why Michael Furlong can keep his head up, knowing he is innocent. He has not worked a day since 2022, when he was fired from his assembly-line role at Jaguar Land Rover. Since then he has never had never paid taxes and consequently has a soul that is entirely unblemished of any kind of sin. 

Do you sense the injustice of this scenario? Michael, a man who has strived his whole life for the kind of moral clarity that you and I could only dream of \- this paragon of virtue is being persecuted by a government gone mad. This saint has been treated like a common criminal.  
   
In a sense, when the unclothed Michael Furlong grappled with that police officer, we were all with him? In this England gone mad, we are all fighting PC 5891 in nothing but our underwear. 

**Tax It's actually a voluntary, but it's only if you use that corporate need, which is in a dog latin glosset or cap, which has no standing in a constitutional court, no grammatical standing in a constitutional court. This is why they call it spelling, it's witchcraft.**

11\. Someday, legal scholars will want to parse Michael Furlong’s legal wisdom. When the new era of jurisprudence is upon us and this old system, this corrupt system, has been wiped from our collective memory banks, a new order will exist.

This will be a world in which the only people who have to pay tax are corporations in need of a dog Latin glossa \- the precise meaning of this phrase will be ruminated and cogitated upon by legal minds vastly more complex than my feeble cerebellum. 

For the likes of us, we may never understand these cosmic words, the mystical incantations that, when ushered into a court of law, compel the judge to find Michael Innocent.

He’s innocent; I tell you \- if there’s one thing we can all take from this travesty, this gross miscarriage of justice. Michael is the victim here. The police should return the 20 grams of cannabis resin they took from him and thank him for exposing the criminality of the system.

Better still, we should offer Michael Furlong some kind of honour \- an OBE or a knighthood for his service to our country. His brave sacrifice means we can finally see the error of our foolish ways. 

**I'm here to answer alleged charges for a legal fiction, which I no longer have part of a attorney over, so I'm acting the court of crossfire of your life. I haven't given power of attorney awaits your foreign private trust for the commercial entity Michael Fairlawn.**

12\. What the court system may not yet fully appreciate is that Michael Furlong, who was arrested carrying a small quantity of a controlled substance with an alleged intent to supply, is an entirely different Michael from the one who has been summoned before the crown court. 

They may look suspiciously similar, uncannily similar to your uneducated eye \- but that is because you don’t have the legal training that would allow you to penetrate the mystical and unseen. 

So allow me to correct what your lying eyes tell you: Michael Henry, who stands accused of a drug offence, has been severed from the fictional legal personality of the man who was caught cycling around the streets of Liverpool with a pocket full of Moroccan black-tar hashish. 

Any similarity between these two men is purely coincidental, meaningless, and the sort of thing the court should disregard. Under no circumstances should this Michael Henry be held responsible for the behaviour of the old Michael Henry… who we have established is an entirely different person. 

But who could make such a complicated argument in a British criminal court? What kind of first-rate legal mind could convey the subtleties and details of this highly sensible legal defence? Fortunately, TPR has access to brilliant minds like this chap \- Peter:

**Peter, you're the power of attorney today, mate, yeah?**  
**Yeah, that's right.**  
**Okay, can you tell us what's not happened today?**  
**Well today, what we're going to do is we're going to issue a limited power of attorney to Michael Henry so that he can speak under special visitation.**

13: But Liverpool TPR aren’t the kinds of people who would ever come to court with just one strategy. They are taking a belt-and-braces approach to Michael’s legal defence. A strategy with multiple defensive walls, like the castle we heard about earlier. 

They say that the best defence is offence, and when you hear what Peter has in store, you will wonder if the British government has even the slightest thread of credibility left. 

 **Peter, can you tell us about what the Crown's been up to, please, mate?**

 **Well, the Crown Corporation at the moment don't really have any standing whilst currently accused of the following crimes.**

 **Perjury,  false statements by officials regarding vaccine safety and justification for mandates, breach of international law, the Nuremberg Code, mandates for vaccines violated the requirement for informed voluntary consent, human experimentation without clear benefits or sufficient safety testing, the Geneva Conventions, denial of medical autonomy and coercion of medical treatments are prohibited under the international humanitarian law, universal declaration of bioethics and human rights, violations of autonomy, dignity, and the right to refuse medical intervention, Rome statutes of the International Criminal Court, crimes against humanity, including systematic acts causing great suffering and injury, the crimes against the humanity defined under Article 7 of the Rome statute, crimes against humanity include systematic persecution of unvaccinated individuals through discrimination, exclusion, and vilification. Widespread harm caused by coerced medical interventions leading to injury, death, and long-term health consequences, forced medical experiments in the form of mRNA vaccine deployment without sufficient safety or efficacy data, psychological warfare through fear campaigns and propaganda to enforce compliance, economic crimes, destruction of livelihoods, lockdowns, and restrictions led to the collapse of small businesses while disproportionately benefiting multinational corporations, fraudulent enrichment, pharmaceutical companies profited immensely from vaccine sales under contracts that shielded them from liability, economic coercion, citizens were forced to choose between vaccination, maintaining employment, violating economic and labor rights, five, domestic and psychological warfare, censorship and suppression, silencing, dissenting voices, experts and whistleblowers through media and big tech platforms, malfeasance in public office, abuse of power, enforcing mandates without sufficient scientific evidence or legislative scrutiny. Now this has come from the Defence Minister for Canada. Yeah, Head of Defence. Head of Defence for Canada. Now how can you hold a hearing with somebody who's accused of crimes like that? They don't have any standing, so I don't even know where we go from here.**

14: The government has unclean hands—a litany of corruption and failure. It has forfeited its right to judge the impeccable souls of people like Michael and Liverpool People’s Resistance. 

If anything the situation should be reversed \- Michael Furlong should be sitting in the judge’s seat and this judge should be prosecuted because of his failure to recognize the validity and brilliance of Michael Furlong’s legal strategy.

No, even that’s not good enough \- the Catholic church should recognise Michacal as some sort of saint. He’s a living martyr. 

I’m sure you are all wondering: Did Michael plead innocent or guilty of these charges? Did he boldly admit culpability for his actions, or did he stare the judge in the eyes, and dare him to accuse an innocent man.

**But he put the plea in. I can't plea. He put the plea in, it's not guilty. But no one can contact in the name of another. So it's a bit bizarre.**

15\. If you had guessed that sovereign citizens believe that the categories of guilt and innocence do not apply to them because sovereign individuals are beyond good and evil, then award yourself another gold star.

Don’t be shy; you earned it with your quick-witted deductive skills, tenacity and attention to detail. And most of all, your knowledge of the sovereign citizen movement.

This show is almost over, but now but just look at yourself, swanning around with two gold stars. You must be feeling rather proud of yourself right now. 

Sooner or later, somebody will walk up to you and ask why you are wearing two gold stars.

And you can explain that you got them from Mind of Steele, a funny internet show abou British conspiracy theory culture, and she should definitely watch it too.

And she will respond with enthusiasm and glee.

And that’s how you can help me grow the channel.  

Michael Furlong’s trial will be in September of 2025, and I will certainly report on it as soon as I have news. I’m certain it will make legal history, perhaps establishing the furlong doctrine alongside the castle and clearfield doctrines. 

But I wonder what it could be?

**Well, I think they're going to put me down for a jury trial. But I'd like to invoke me rights for the Bill of Rights as a trial by jury because if the members of the jury are on the elects or the register that would make them state-owned enterprises. So they won't be my peers. They'll be subjects in the Crown. Now a sovereign cannot be subject. So I need sovereign men of my jury. And I'm going to evoke me right to that.**

16\. That’s right \- Miochel seeks to enshrine the principle that juries should be as insane as the person they judge. 

Only the most truly delusional visionaries, loonies and nincompoops have the righ to consider themselves peers with Michael
