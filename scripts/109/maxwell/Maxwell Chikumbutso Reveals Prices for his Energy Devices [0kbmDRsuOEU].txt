 10,000 United States dollars. That's the starting price of Markzoo Jikumbutsu's Microsonic energy-powered devices for vehicles



 So some more Markzoo Jikumbutsu news The Zimbabwean inventor has just released his price list for his microsonic energy-powered devices For vehicles. Well, not the price exactly but the starting price and you're going to need



 10,000 big ones to get a kit now to be honest before Markzoo Jikumbutsu shared this I was actually thinking that the Microsonic energy powered device was just one component Maybe one engine which will fit into your car or retrofit into your existing vehicle But it turns out it's actually a whole system altogether Actually the kit includes the microsonic energy device itself a motor controller an Integrated controller actually here's a full list of other components You can pause your screen to read the rest now I'm thinking that the $10,000 price is for light vehicles and trucks You will need to pay more obviously if you want the microsonic energy device retrofitted on your heavy-duty trucks and buses Including earth moving equipment, but just imagine a truck that doesn't need to be refueled



 So I was just talking to mark so and he said if you don't want any retrofitting done You can always buy the kai safe vehicle, which he showcased it will cost you $15,000 that doesn't include shipping and other costs now disclaimer I'm not encouraging anyone to buy mark so to kombucha products You need to do your own you diligence before you part with your money. Let me just put that out there Now I've had a lot of emails from all around the world asking me how they can buy mark so she kombucha's Inventions, I think the best person to answer that at the moment is mark So she kombucha himself you can get in touch directly with him using the email on the screen or his ex account Now personally, I think he's still setting up the whole thing That is why when he shared the price list, he also invited investors distributors and Collaborators to work with him. So if that's something that you like to do then get in touch with him Sadly, we don't have prices for his other microsonic energy powered devices when I get that info I would definitely share with you guys.
