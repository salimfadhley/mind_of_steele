 We have already been said that necessity is a model of all inventions But there comes a time when an invention comes along that makes us doubt everything we have known as real My girl Chikun Butsuo, an inverter from Zimbabwe and founder of the said technologies has created the microsonic Invection that helps you power cars, planes, your house, your fridge, your TV without the use of any known energy source This is the ill report and I am your host Enochina Doris But before getting to the video, make sure to like and subscribe to the next generation media channel So you don't get to miss out on any of our subsequent videos So this invention by Maxwell Chikun Butsuo promises to bring a revolution to energy resources But if it is as authentic as it claims to be then you can be well assured that this man Maxwell Chikun Butsuo Is about to have a lot of allies as well as a lot of enemies Before getting to the entire issue, let's listen to Maxwell Chikun Butsuo talk about his invention



 Before we get to the end of the video, we have been working with four years, they have tested it Some of them they have bought my products before We are in the commercial stage starting from tomorrow, we have got small machines Most of them they have been bought with these guys who came, we have got guys from TLC He bought some machines as well, we didn't have much but right now we are now in operation



 We have got an order for 3000 machines for South Africa and they give us 20,000 machines for Zambia That's a TACE Rosa, the one that you saw, I have been working with him for so many years Ok, so that is Maxwell Chikun Butsuo talking about his invention About how it is not blowing up into sales, there are now thousands and tens of thousands of sales that they are doing that's in cars Now a little backstory on Maxwell Chikun Butsuo, this is a guy, you would think that was such an invention He had completed his course, some sort of maybe big engineer, but actually he says school dropout Dropped out of school at the age of 14, he moved to the US, he started a company called Technologies And we will find out more of the things that are happening in the US as we go down into this episode But I would like us to proceed now into the different inventions that this is, microsonic inventions, able to power We mentioned the fact that now we can have planes, cars, TVs, fridges, that can be powered by the microsonic inventions So what this particular means is that the fuel that we are using, electrical energy, we might actually have no use for it in the future guys Like this is how big this invention is, he has reached a point where you can power a TV without the use of fuel Without the use of electricity, power your cars, power planes, power houses without electricity, this is how big this invention is So many people are claiming that his inventions are fake, that he says karma, but I would like to differ Because when I looked into Maxwell, I found out that he had created inventions that he has somewhat of a train of inventions that are leading to what he's producing to us today He had made three years ago, I believe, the self-powered TV And that already shows us that the present state of having self-powered cars, planes, things that a car can charge your fridge It's a possibility if we're looking back at what he has already done So we're going to take a look at the self-powered TV that he made three years ago And now what he is presenting to us is self-powered cars, presenting the self-powered planes and all of that Let's take a look back three years ago to his man's inventions This is our self-powered TV that we have designed The first in the world to have such kind of a technology, where a television is powered with a radio frequency So as you can see, right now I'm powering this television



 So this is the first television in the world that uses self-powered say It is all in one You don't need to put it on electricity or on solar panel or anything It is a complete solution That's so cool Behind the television you can see that there is a microsonic energy device, this box This is the device that is converting So the price card does the heart of the invention, the microsonic device That uses not to power all the inventions So it is somehow unnecessary radio frequency and now turns into energy that powers different gadgets The frequencies into pure energy As you can see, the power of the cable was supposed to be here On all traditional televisions, power comes here But there's no power as you can see The television is, it is working as it is So in London, I think this television is a, we can call it a self-powered television So that is three years ago, him already having a self-powered TV And now let's look at today's day and age where he has the self-powered car Where he went and presented this car to the president of Zimbabwe I really like the fact that Zimbabwe government or the president is in support of these innovations We have been looking for revolutionary inventions who come from Africa So I really appreciate the fact that the government, the president stood by him in this invention Cautioning the fact that he has faced a lot of difficulties with the rest of the world concerning this invention In the world, this is part of the sky Yeah, from the red of the banks This one, you're helping this market Yes, we have done it in Zimbabwe Where is the sky? Yeah



 So the vehicle is part of what we call a microsonic energy device Myself, I don't know how to speak It's a machine It's a machine I gotta go slow, guys Yeah, the vehicle, it uses what we call the microsonic energy device The microsonic energy device, it is the device that I personally invented in 2009 Which harnesses radio frequencies into energy As you know, radio frequencies, they are measured in nano volts Meaning to say they are less than a volt, they are just like nothing But we find a way of harnessing it through the creation of the 70% of the components in the microsonic energy Which I've telemetered and designed So those are the components that enable the radio frequencies to be transferred into pure, useful energy And this is the first time in the world So they wanted to understand for change in physics Yes, yes Even when we tried to find a patent, they said we are violating the natural laws of physics So it's not an industrial applicable We decided to take the trade secret route after that So in this car, you can also use it to power your house It is a moving generator When you drive from work, back to your home, you can connect your power cable Then you can power your house It gives you 15 kilowatts power to power your house So that is Maxwell Chikumbosso talking to the president of Zimbabwe about his revolutionary invention And if I look into the fact that since we began this year, I've had a lot of bad news A lot of bad things we have reported on I'm so happy that we're having a very interesting thing we're reporting on So this club for this year is beginning to look up for us And when we look into this, we should think that it's just supposed to be something that the entire world should be happy about We're going to be saving on money, saving on resources and everything But funny enough, there are a lot of haters for this particular invention Like it's very controversial And for valid reasons to our sake, some valid reasons and others I believe are just very stupid The very first reason they said was that it violates the laws of physics Which I believe is the most stupid reason why people are hating on this invention I mean for goodness sakes, it is a breakthrough in science Whenever something has to be a breakthrough in science, it has to break a law When we look at many other inventions at points, it's impossible They told us that Mox Tesla was impossible A lot of things that they told Paul, this is impossible



 They people went ahead and they realized, no I'm not going to listen to you, I'm going to listen to the fact that I can do this So when Paul is saying no, we cannot agree for this particular invention Because it breaks the laws that existed before even though we're trying to revolutionize and make new things We cannot allow the new things to surpass the old things That's what makes sense to me Secondly, they said there are not so many verifications to his work Not many Paul have studied and verified his work, which I believe is somewhat of a legit reason For me, I feel like that's one thing I actually agree with Because I found that just particularly one university had done studies on their work and approved it But usually for things like this that are maybe like the same, breaking the laws of physics, making revolutionary Things that we have known for years and years, we're about to see that it can actually be different We need a lot of verification, a lot of studies to back it up The third reason why we find this to be very controversial is the fact that it has a lot of secrecy in it And not his fault, I would say, he just really requires that his invention be kept secret because it has not been patented When he went to Gansoma license, they refused, they say, "Oh, it is a basic laws of physics" So he has embedded a self-destruct sequence in his invention Meaning if anybody tries to alter anything, tries to dig too deep into understanding how it is formed The invention automatically self-destruct And he says that it's going to be somewhat of an explosion, but not a very loud explosion So as to hurt anybody, just an explosion enough to destroy the instrument So we get to find out that nobody can actually know how, what is the nitty gritty behind this invention How is it working? He just tells us that it uses radio frequencies to produce energy We cannot know, I actually have to blame the pod that refused to patent their work for why We cannot know because it was not patented He would not allow somebody now to come and steal his work And now use it to maybe go and foster the idea and get money before he can actually make profit from what he has invented himself And the very last reason why this his invention is controversial, which I also found to be very interesting The fact that he insists that when he is doing his invention, he's some sort of a divine inspiration He can have these dreams where God shows him and teaches him about these inventions So when he sees scientists, we know scientists, they are really trying to prove against the existence of God When you find someone who is now a scientist and he says he has mixed God's divine intervention to produce this They are going to come against it because they have to admit that God exists in a way to accept this Because he's saying, "I got this, but it came from some sort of a dream, it came from some sort of God sending me inspiration to do this



 So scientists are really against it also because the fact that he has said it has some sort of a divine intervention to it So this is where I think this guy and other scientists, because he himself is a scientist Regardless of the fact that he dropped out at 14, he has done what other scientists could not do And maybe it does the fact that other scientists maybe never had God, never asked God for inspiration I don't know And he has made this revolutionary invention But regardless, we have realized that anything that scientists have been able to make over the time when I was inspired by whatever We are able to prove at some point in time So I believe that it's not a case of just some sort of maybe voodoo, spiritual, that, that, that But we would know more about this invention if it was given the legal rights to be patented Like that's just what's lacking Allow him to have the rights to protect his things legally Then maybe we can find out actually how this invention comes about And I also believe that men put a don't want to know how this invention came to be Because if we look at it intensely, what this actually means Because we can think that okay, yes, if you put Zimbabwe on the map, it's going to put Zimbabwe at the forefront of clean energy They are the good things for using costs But then we have the companies behind that are making millions, billions out of this fuel energy, electrical energy on cars That will lose millions and billions of wealth to this particular invention So you see that the people out there who actually resist invention does not come to light And if you go forward to listen to him talking to the president about this invention Because it's a very long video, I believe like eight minutes He mentioned a particular scenario where he and someone who worked on the invention when they were in America They got poisoned and one of them died And he suspects that this was not allowed this invention to meet the market He said he had hit men that were sent after him and he had to run And the Zimbabwe government called him to come and have his business stationed in the country Where they could protect him and they could help him to foster the invention So we see that just because of how much people are somehow being afraid of this invention reaching the market It's not just a fact of maybe it's a scam But maybe because it's actually the invention of the century Maybe this invention can change the world for us, can reduce expenses, can do so much for those people who cannot afford maybe high fuel prices, electricity A new one might become unwanted at a point in time if this invention is to go broadway That's how big it is, that's how much these big companies are afraid of this invention So in as much as there's a lot of secrecy behind the invention, I believe it's for a good reason And I really like to have hope and faith in this invention Because the fact that many people are coming against it and they are not letting him somehow prove the point Shows that they have something to hide, they are saying that they might lose millions and billions to this particular invention And they don't just want to lose that money, I believe that's the case They want to hold on to the millions and billions they are making from the people already Because imagine if all of a sudden we don't need to have fuel stations Normally fuel stations we have just in like a town, more than 50 All of those at one point will have to shut down the nearest coming future That's how much money certain companies are going to lose, people are going to shut down their companies There's this invention now that allows people to have all this at a lower price because that's something else His invention comes at a lower price, lower management So it's a lot of reduction in expenses that some people might not want us to have So when we're checking this Zimbabwe is looking to have its biggest breakthrough Causing the fact that Maxwell is from Zimbabwe So Zimbabwe would definitely be put on the forefront when it concerns countries that are providing clean energy We're going to have less of carbon secretions, the atmosphere that is going to be helpful for our environment But then again like we have talked about, they are going to be having a lot of enemies, a lot of fights From the rest of the world that may be enjoying the fuel prices increasing left and right And making benefits from it, they're not going to be so happy, okay guys But I'm really looking forward to this invention being true, being proved, being sent out And I can't really feel like this year might just get better because of this So fingers crossed, I really wish more grace to Maxwell to Kumbootso I really hope you are not a scammer, please guys, don't be a scammer, okay, don't break our hearts Let this be an invention that's going to revolutionize clean energy for the world And that's all for the video guys, thank you for joining us on this
