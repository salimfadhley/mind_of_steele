 It gives you 15 kilowatts power over your house. Zimbabwe is a game-changing first-of-a-kind innovation. Zimbabwean inventor Maxwell Sangyalani Chikambutso has just shocked the world by unveiling the first self-powered car, a revolutionary feat that defies conventional science and places Zimbabwe at the forefront of global energy innovation. This extraordinary breakthrough, achieved through his invention of the microsonic energy device, harnesses radio frequencies from the atmosphere and converts them into usable electrical energy. Unlike traditional vehicles that rely on fossil fuels or rechargeable batteries, Chikambutso's car draws power directly from the air, providing an unlimited energy supply and eliminating the need for refueling or recharging. This groundbreaking technology has the potential to disrupt the global automotive industry, making gasoline engines and lithium-ion batteries obsolete while ushering in a new era of eco-friendly and economically transformative transportation. The significance of Chikambutso's invention is monumental, as it challenges long-standing scientific principles, particularly the first law of thermodynamics, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. If this technology can be scaled, it could completely revolutionize not only the automotive sector, but also the global energy landscape. A world where cars, homes, and industries run on free, atmospheric energy is one that would render conventional power grids and fuel industries irrelevant, potentially shaking the very foundations of the global economy. This has led many to ask, has Zimbabwean inventor Maxwell Sangulani Chikambutso proved famous inventor Nikola Tesla right about the existence of free energy sources?



 Before we dive into this story, we must first know about Tesla. Nikola Tesla was a genius Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to automating current AC electricity. Born in Smilgin in the Austrian Empire, modern-day Croatia, he moved to the U.S. in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before pioneering wireless energy transmission, radio waves, and the Tesla coil. His rivalry with Edison in the war of currents helped establish AC as the dominant electrical system. Despite holding over 300 patents, Tesla struggled financially and died impoverished in New York. His visionary ideas, including wireless power and robotics, influenced modern technology and earned him posthumous recognition as one of history's greatest inventors. Nikola Tesla's work in energy and electricity was revolutionary, laying the foundation for modern power systems, wireless communication, and even early concepts of renewable energy. He championed alternating current, AC, over Thomas Edison's direct current, DC, which eventually became the global standard due to its efficiency in long-distance transmission.



 Beyond AC, Tesla was obsessed with the idea of wireless energy transmission, believing that the Earth itself could be used as a conductor to provide limitless free electricity to the world. His warding cliff tower, built in the early 1900s with the backing of financier GP Morgan, was intended to transmit power wirelessly across great distances. However, Morgan abruptly withdrew funding, allegedly because Tesla's system could not be metered, meaning energy could be freely available without profit. Tesla's research into harnessing the natural electromagnetic properties of the Earth and atmosphere remained largely unexplored, as corporate interests favored centralized, billable energy models over his radical innovations.



 This abrupt end to Tesla's wireless energy project has fueled the free energy suppression conspiracy theory, which suggests that powerful industrialists, particularly those in the fossil fuel and banking industries, deliberately obstructed Tesla's work to maintain control over the energy sector. According to this theory, Tesla's discoveries in harnessing radio frequencies and atmospheric electricity posed a direct threat to the profits of energy monopolies, prompting suppression through financial starvation, media blackouts, and even government intervention. Some theorists claim that after Tesla's death in 1943, the US government seized its papers under national security concerns, potentially hiding breakthroughs that could have made electricity freely available to all. While mainstream science remains skeptical of Tesla's alleged free energy devices, the persistent suppression narrative suggests that deep-rooted resistance to technologies that could dismantle the global energy economy, leaving Tesla's grand vision unrealized. But has Tesla's vision of a free energy device just been realized through Zimbabwean inventor Maxwell Cangulani Chikambuso? Unlike most inventors who had formal education and worked in well-equipped laboratories, Chikambuso's journey as an inventor was entirely self-taught. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, he began experimenting with discarded electronic components as a child, crafting rudimentary devices that stunned those around him. His early creations included a makeshift radio transmitter and a digital navigator, which demonstrated his innate ability to conceptualize and build sophisticated systems without any formal engineering training. Despite facing numerous challenges, he persevered and continued refining his work, eventually leading to the invention of the Microsonic Energy Device in 2009.



 This revolutionary device allows radio frequencies in the atmosphere, effectively creating an inexhaustible power source. By integrating this technology into automobiles, Chikambuso has engineered a vehicle that can run indefinitely without needing to stop for fuel or charging. If implemented on a large scale, this innovation could provide a game-changing solution to energy crisis around the world, particularly in Africa, where millions still lack access to reliable electricity. It could significantly lower transportation costs, reduce reliance on imported fuel, and propel Africa into a new era of technological advancement and economic independence.



 However, Chikambuso's journey has not been without adversity. He has faced intense opposition, particularly from powerful entities within the oil and automotive industries. He claims that during a visit to Silicon Valley, he and his research partner were poisoned, an event he believes was orchestrated by those who saw his work as a threat to the status quo. Tragically, his research partner did not survive, reinforcing the notion that disruptive inventors often face serious risks when challenging deeply entrenched industries. His experience aligns with the long history of free energy suppression, where inventors like Stanley Mayer, Eugen Malle, and even Nikola Tesla encountered mysterious obstacles, threats, and in some cases, untimely deaths.



 According to the free energy suppression conspiracy theory, big industries, government agencies, and corporate powers actively work to discredit and suppress revolutionary energy technologies. They use tactics such as media blackouts, academic pressure, and even outright legal and financial intimidation to ensure that disruptive technologies never reach the masses. Claims of suppression include accusations that the scientific community, controlled by vested interests, systematically rejects research into alternative energy sources. There are also allegations that working free energy devices have been created but remain hidden due to the fear that they could dismantle the multi-trillion dollar fossil fuel industry.



 If Chikun Butso's car is truly self-powered, it represents the single greatest challenge to the global energy monopoly in modern history. His work directly threatens the profits of oil companies, electric vehicle manufacturers, and even traditional power utilities. This explains why so many powerful people have attempted to discredit him. The financial implications of free energy are astronomical. If every household, vehicle, and factory could run on freely available atmospheric energy, the entire global economic structure would be reshaped overnight.



 Governments and corporations would no longer be able to exert control through energy dependence, and the balance of power would shift dramatically in favor of the people.



 At this critical moment, Africa and the world must rally behind Maxwell's Sangilani Chikun Butso. His invention has the potential to redefine human civilization, liberating people from the constraints of energy scarcity and environmental degradation. If his technology is given the recognition and support it deserves, it could mark the beginning of a new era where energy is abundant, clean, and free for all. Chikun Butso has done what Nikola Tesla could not. He has taken the dream of limitless energy and turned it into a reality. Now, the world must decide whether to embrace this revolutionary future or allow powerful interests to bury yet another breakthrough that could benefit humanity.



 As Africans, we have a responsibility to protect and uplift our own innovators. Maxwell's Sangilani Chikun Butso has gifted the world with a technological marvel that could change the course of history. Now is the time for governments, investors, and ordinary citizens to champion his work and ensure that his vision is not lost to the forces of suppression. If we stand together, we can support a future where energy is no longer a commodity controlled by a select few, but a universal resource accessible to all. The dawn of the self-powered car is here, and with it comes the promise of a world powered by boundless free energy. Let us not allow this moment to slip away. Your perspective matters.
