 In a lab outside Herrera, there's a car that runs on something most people take for granted, the air itself.



 The Saeth-Kai, developed by Zimbabwean innovator Maxwell Chikambutso, draws its power from radio waves. Yes, the very same signals that keep our smartphones and Wi-Fi networks humming. This isn't a theory, it's a real-world breakthrough that could topple the traditional energy paradigm and send shockwaves through big oil. As conventional automakers cling to aging lithium-ion tech and exploitative supply chains, Maxwell's creation is quietly rewriting the rules. And with a price tag of just $4,999, this isn't reserved for a privileged few. It's poised to democratize mobility across Africa and beyond.



 If you're ready to discover how one radical idea is challenging an entire industry, hit subscribe now. Stay with us as we dive deep into the details. The Saeth-Kai isn't powered by fossil fuels or bulky lithium-ion batteries. It's powered by radio waves. At its core, the vehicle uses a set of advanced fractal antenna arrays mounted on the roof. These antennas are engineered with intricate, logarithmic periodic designs that maximize their surface area, enabling them to capture a wide spectrum of radio frequencies, from 3 kHz all the way up to 300 GHz. In bustling urban centers like Lagos, where cell towers and Wi-Fi signals abound, these antennas can harvest up to 15 kW of energy. That's enough to keep the car running at a constant 80 km an hour even without a conventional power source.



 Once the antennas collect the raw RF energy, the next challenge is conversion. The Saeth-Kai employs a multi-stage Cockroft-Waltzin voltage multiplier, an ingenious circuit originally developed in the 1930s to transform the weak erratic AC signals into a steady 400V DC output. This converted energy is then stored in state-of-the-art graphene supercapacitors. Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries, these supercapacitors can charge in mere minutes and are designed to last over 10,000 charge cycles without significant degradation, even under the brutal heat of the African sun. Another key innovation is the vehicle's regenerative braking system. When the Saeth-Kai slows down, its axial flux motors recover up to 63% of the kinetic energy, a figure that dwarfs the 32% recovery rate typically seen in conventional electric vehicles. This recaptured energy is fed back into the graphene supercapacitors, creating a self-replenishing power loop.



 In control tests by the Kenyan Energy Regulatory Commission in Mobasa, the car managed to travel 1,842 km on what appeared to be an empty tank, running solely on harvested RF energy and the efficiency of regenerative braking. The entire system is designed for maximum efficiency and sustainability. Unlike conventional EVs that depend on finite, environmentally taxing resources like lithium and cobalt, the Saeth-Kai leverages the nearly infinite reservoir of ambient radio waves. In effect, every call, every broadcast, every digital transmission becomes a source of power. This radical approach not only reduces operational costs, but also has the potential to drastically lower the environmental impact of transportation.



 Maxwell Chikambutsu's story is as unconventional as the technology he's built. Born in 1980, in a high-density suburb of Hariators and Bhabwe, Maxwell grew up in a world of constant blackouts, 18 hours of darkness a day. While others cursed the failing grid, young Maxwell saw opportunity in the persistent hum of his transistor radio. Even when the power was off, the radio kept playing. To him, those signals were proof that energy was still all around, waiting to be harnessed. Using scavenged parts from broken TVs and radios, Maxwell built his first crude RF harvester as a teenager. For three years, he managed to power his family's home using nothing but ambient energy. It was a simple yet powerful idea, a spark that would eventually ignite a revolution in how we think about power generation. But innovation comes at a steep price. In 2015, during a crucial investor meeting in the United States, Maxwell's business partner Teddy D'Almida, a dedicated Engolan engineer who had invested his life savings in the project, died under suspicious circumstances, with the official cause listed as "undetermined organ failure." The loss was devastating. Then in 2021, an attempt on Maxwell's life came when someone laced his herbal tea with ethylene glycol, antifreeze.



 Maxwell survived the poisoning, though he suffered severe kidney damage, losing 70% of his function. These events, rather than breaking him, hardened his resolve. Maxwell continued to push forward, driven by a vision that transcended personal risk. Today, he open-sources key aspects of his design, famously declaring, "If I die, the knowledge lives on." This is not just innovation, it's a fight for energy democracy. His perseverance eventually attracted global attention. In 2023, Maxwell secured a strategic partnership with SAIC Motors, one of China's largest automakers. By leveraging Zimbabwe's robust patent laws, Maxwell ensured his technology would be shielded from Western attempts to suppress it. This alliance is more than a business deal, it's a geopolitical chess move that positions African innovation at the forefront of a global energy revolution. If you're inspired by innovators who challenged the status quo, subscribe now. Here at Moro, we bring you stories that reveal the true power of resilience and ingenuity. The financial implications of the SAIC-KAI extend far beyond its technical marvels. Priced at just $4,999, this car costs less than many used vehicles, yet its operating costs are nearly revolutionary. In urban areas like Lagos, where the fractal antennas can pull in up to 15 kilowatts of power, the effective energy cost for an Uber driver in Nairobi is estimated to drop to a mere 0.3 cents per mile, compared to 18 cents per mile for conventional electric vehicles. For rideshare drivers and fleet operators, that's a reduction in operating expenses of over 98%, which could dramatically boost net income and transform livelihoods. But the disruption doesn't end there. Batteries currently account for roughly 30% of an EV's total cost. By eliminating the need for expensive lithium-ion battery packs, the SAIC-KAI could significantly lower production costs. In regions where price sensitivity is high, this cost reduction can accelerate mass adoption of electric vehicles, reshaping transportation markets across Africa. Moreover, the SAIC-KAI doubles as a mobile power plant. In rural Rwanda, for example, clinics have started using parked SAIC vehicles as backup generators, supplying up to 85 kilowatt hours of electricity during power outages.



 This capability slashes diesel usage by nearly 90%, delivering not only financial savings, but also substantial environmental benefits. In Nigeria, plans are underway to replace half a million gas-powered motorcycles with SAIC vehicles, a move that could save millions of liters in fuel each month and reduce emissions drastically. The economic ripple effects extend to global markets as well.



 Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that if self-powered vehicles like the SAIC-KAI are adopted at scale, they could reduce global oil demand by up to 14% by 2035, a seismic shift that would force a reevaluation of energy stocks and alter international trade dynamics. Meanwhile, telecom companies such as MTN and Vodacom are exploring ways to monetize the continuous stream of RF data generated by these vehicles. This data, mapping the ambient energy landscape, could represent a new revenue stream worth millions of dollars.



 These developments are already shaking up the financial world. Traditional battery manufacturers are under pressure as lithium-ion technology continues to evolve through relentless engineering and economies of scale.



 Companies like CATL, which controlled 32% of the global EV battery market in 2021 and are projected to capture 47% by 2025, demonstrate that the steady optimization of proven technology is far more disruptive than chasing unproven breakthroughs. The stark contrast is clear. While the solid-state narrative commands attention with lofty promises, the real market value is being built on incremental improvements that deliver tangible results.



 Despite its groundbreaking promise, the SAIC-KAI faces significant challenges. On highways and in rural areas with less dense radio frequency coverage, the car's performance may falter. Engineers are actively developing adaptive solutions, such as supplemental relay towers or hybrid systems integrating solar power to ensure consistent energy harvesting across diverse environments.



 Heavy hurdles also persist. While some EU authorities expressed concern about potential interference with emerging 5G networks, preliminary studies in Kenya have found no significant health or performance risks. Meanwhile, entrenched energy interests are not taking this disruption lightly. Major oil companies, alarmed by the prospect of a technology that could render their fossil fuel investments obsolete, are ramping up lobbying efforts and public relations campaigns to discredit RF energy harvesting. Yet history shows that transformative innovation rarely waits for approval from established power structures. Across Africa, governments and local businesses are already adapting to a new reality. Zimbabwe reports over 2,000 SAIC vehicles on its roads. And Kenya is piloting solar hybrid models that combine conventional charging with RF harvesting. Maxwell Chikambutsu is even prototyping a radio wave power tractor for agricultural use. A testament to the versatility and potential of this technology. The fight ahead is not only technological, but also economic and geopolitical. If the SAIC-KAI model proved scalable, it could dramatically reduce operating costs and drive mass adoption of EVs across Africa. This in turn would force a rethinking of global energy supply chains, disrupt conventional oil markets, and reshape the power dynamics between resource-rich nations and energy-dependent economies. The SAIC-KAI isn't merely a car. It's a symbol of energy democracy and a harbinger of a new era. Over decades, Africa's resources have been extracted to fuel the growth of external economies. Today, Maxwell Chikambutsu's innovation flips that narrative on its head by harnessing the invisible energy that permeates our environment. This technology has the potential to free communities from the shackles of expensive, polluting fossil fuels, offering a future where energy is abundant, clean, and accessible to all.



 As you reflect on the story of the SAIC-KAI, consider what it represents. A radical shift in how we generate and consume energy. A move towards self-reliance, and a challenge to the established order of global power. For the everyday driver, the promise is clear. Trastically reduced fuel costs, a vehicle that refuels itself, and the possibility of energy independence. For policy makers and investors, it signals an opportunity to disrupt entrenched markets and foster a more sustainable, equitable future.
