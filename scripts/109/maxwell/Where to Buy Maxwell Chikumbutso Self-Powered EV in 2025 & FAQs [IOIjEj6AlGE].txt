 The world may be on the edge of redefining what we believe is possible. We are talking about Maxwell Chikumbuzzo, an inventor who has gained attention with claims of a self-paged car, a vehicle that does not require charging or refueling. This is not just an idea on paper. Chikumbuzzo insists that working prototypes already exist and are functional. Naturally, the Internet is filled with excitement, doubt and a mix of reactions. Some call it a revolutionary step forward, while others question whether it is real, which is understandable. Extraordinary claims always require extraordinary proof. That is why we are here to examine the details, separate facts from speculation and address the most important questions. When will this car be released? Where can you buy it? How much will it cost? And most importantly, is this technology real? Let's take a closer look. So, when can you actually get behind the wheel of Chikumbuzzo's electric car? As of now, the vehicle remains in the development stage with no official launch date. However, Chikumbuzzo and his team at Saït Technologies are actively working to make the car road-ready. This is more than just building a car. It is about transforming the entire industry. They are not simply assembling car parts. They are changing the way we think about energy use in transportation. Such a massive technological advancement takes time to refine, test and ensure that it meets safety and reliability standards for daily use. While an exact launch date has not been confirmed, there are signs of progress. Saït Technologies has hinted at possible partnerships and is engaging with investors. Instead of keeping everything behind closed doors, they are openly seeking collaborations to make this technology accessible to the public. Unlike major Silicon Valley companies with limitless funding, they are carefully securing resources to expand production. Even Tesla started small before becoming a global leader. Groundbreaking technology does not appear overnight, but it is evident that Chikumbuzzo and his team are making meaningful progress and are determined to bring this car to market sooner rather than later. If this self-paved vehicle becomes a reality, where will you be able to purchase one? Traditional car dealerships may not be the primary option due to the uniqueness of this technology. A different sales and distribution approach may be required. One possibility is direct-to-consumer online sales, similar to Tesla's model. Imagine customizing your self-pager car online, selecting your preferred features and having it delivered to your doorstep. Another option is forming partnerships with existing electric vehicle dealerships to utilize their infrastructure and customer network. However, with any revolutionary invention, scams are inevitable. If this car gains widespread attention, expect to see fake claims and unauthorized pre-orders. Until Saït Technologies makes official statements, be cautious of offers from unofficial sources. Always refer to their official channels for trustworthy updates. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Chikumbuzzo has mentioned that the commercialization process has already started, with units being produced and sold. Some reports indicate that buyers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe and South Africa have already placed orders. Reports suggest that 3,000 units were ordered for South Africa with an additional 200, 0, 0 for Zambia. Discussions are also happening with potential partners in Switzerland, and at least one vehicle and a motorbike have been purchased by Swiss representatives. Developing a groundbreaking invention is not just about creativity, it requires funding, resources and solid support. This is particularly true in the electric vehicle industry, where the stakes are extremely high. Innovators need access to advanced labs, skilled engineers and high-tech manufacturing facilities to bring their ideas to life. While specific corporate investors have not been publicly disclosed, there is speculation that global energy companies, automotive manufacturers and technology investors are showing interest. These organizations see the potential for groundbreaking advancements and want to be involved in the next big step in technology. Their backing could provide the necessary capital and industry expertise to accelerate development. One of the most notable endorsements comes from Zimbabwe's government, which has acknowledged Chikumbutsu's work and even provided land for research facilities. This kind of governmental support is invaluable as it offers not only space for innovation, but also adds credibility to the project. Such recognition can lead to further opportunities, including international partnerships and additional funding. If given the right support, Chikumbutsu's technology could have a significant impact, not just locally but globally, reshaping industries and improving lives. Chikumbutsu states that his car operates using a micronic energy device, which he reportedly invented in 2009. This device supposedly converts radio frequencies into usable energy, a concept that contradicts traditional physics. He claims that this technology defies the known laws of thermodynamics and energy conversion, making it ineligible for conventional patents. Due to this, he chose to keep the technology a trade secret. According to him, the car can also act as a mobile power source, capable of supplying up to 15kW of electricity to a home. This means that in case of a power outage, the vehicle can keep essential appliances running, a major advantage over conventional generators. Imagine using your car to power your refrigerator, lights, and charge your electronic devices during a blackout.



 Regarding performance, the vehicle features a 160kW electric motor, equivalent to approximately 214 horsepower. This powerful engine ensures that the car can perform well in various driving conditions, from city roads to highways. The torque range is between 320 and 380 Newton meters, providing strong acceleration and a smooth driving experience. This level of torque ensures that the vehicle responds efficiently to the driver's commands, making it both practical and enjoyable to drive. Additionally, the car is capable of reaching a top speed of 220k slash h, putting it on par with several high-performance electric vehicles available today. Whether you are on a long-distance trip or just taking a weekend drive, this car is built to get you to your destination quickly and efficiently.



 It also includes two driving modes, sport mode and normal mode. The sport mode allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 100k slash h in just about two seconds, providing a thrilling driving experience for speed enthusiasts. On the other hand, the normal mode is optimized for city driving, ensuring a comfortable and energy-efficient ride. This flexibility makes the vehicle suitable for various driving needs, whether for daily commuting or high-speed driving experiences. So how much will this revolutionary car cost? This is the question that everyone wants answered. While no official pricing has been revealed, Chikombuzo has consistently emphasized his commitment to affordability. He envisions a future where clean energy vehicles are not just an elite privilege but an option for the general public. His goal is to produce a car that families can depend on for daily use without it being financially out of reach. If his vision becomes a reality, the price is unlikely to be as high as luxury electric models like Tesla's. Instead, it might fall within the price range of mid-tier electric cars, making it more accessible to a wider audience.



 However, final pricing will be influenced by production expenses, demand and investor support. These factors will ultimately determine whether the car can be manufactured at a cost that aligns with Chikombuzo's vision. If this vehicle truly delivers on its promises at an affordable price, it could shake up the entire auto industry, setting a new standard for what people expect from electric vehicles and making sustainable transportation more attainable for all. Beyond self-pagered cars, Chikombuzo has also developed a self-sustaining generator and a superbike using the same technology. If proven functional, his generator could supply electricity without relying on traditional fuel, potentially benefiting rural regions, developing nations and disaster-stricken areas. His superbike, still largely undisclosed, is said to operate without charging, much like his car. If Chikombuzo's claims turn out to be true, his self-paved vehicle could be one of the most disruptive technological advancements in modern history. However, skepticism remains strong and extraordinary claims require solid proof. For now, we observe, analyze and await new developments. If this technology is legitimate, it could reshape the future of energy, transportation and sustainability forever.
