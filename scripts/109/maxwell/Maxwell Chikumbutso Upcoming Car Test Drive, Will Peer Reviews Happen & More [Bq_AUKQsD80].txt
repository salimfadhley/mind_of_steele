 Big updates from Saeth Technologies. We've got more answers about the road trip, product availability, and peer reviews. But some responses leave us wanting more. If you remember, last week we shared replies from Saeth Technologies about their product launch date and the planned road trip to prove their technology works. Maxwell Chikumbuzzo mentioned in an earlier interview that the trip would be from Egypt to Harari. Well, we've got even more exciting updates today, as Saeth Technologies has replied to some of our other questions. If you missed the previous video, I'll replay it at the end of this one, and I'll also include a clip of Maxwell explaining how his device works. First, let's talk about the availability of Saeth Technologies products outside Zimbabwe.



 We asked if the vehicles and other products would be accessible to people in the diaspora, and the answer we got was a simple "Yes, sure." While this is good news, it's not very detailed. For those wondering, it seems there's a possibility of getting these products worldwide. But don't rush to spend your money just yet. Wait until they prove the technology works and we see peer-to-peer reviews. Speaking of which, we also asked about peer-to-peer reviews. For those who don't know, peer-to-peer reviews involve independent experts testing and verifying the technology. The answer we got was "soon." How soon? We don't know. But this is crucial for building credibility around Maxwell's invention. Next, we asked if independent people like journalists and car reviewers would be part of the road trip to clear doubts. The answer was a big "Yes." They mentioned they'll have people from institutions as well as car people. Not just anyone. We need people who know. This suggests they're planning to involve seasoned car reviewers and experts, which is a great step. However, we hope that by "institutions," they don't just mean Harare Institute of Technology. The VC has been closely associated with Maxwell for years. That I'm sure he is one of the shareholders of Saeth Technologies. So involving scientists or engineers from other universities in Zimbabwe would add much more credibility. Now, here's a fun question. Who would you want to review this car? Would you want someone like MKBHD, the famous Tekken Car reviewer, to test it? If someone with his credibility says the car works, the world would go crazy. But if he says it doesn't, it could sink Maxwell and the entire company. Remember how it went when he received the Fisker Ocean car? The company doesn't exist anymore.



 Sadly, when we asked Saeth Technologies about who they're considering for the road trip, the answer was, "When the time is right, we will share." This leaves us unsure about who might be involved. It's possible they're still reaching out to people. And these things take time. Reviewers might want payment, and there could be NDIS in place. Or maybe they're keeping quiet to avoid the big oil companies from sabotaging the process. That's all the questions we got answers to so far. But we also asked about supplying power to houses in Zimbabwe, especially since Parliament recently highlighted the country's electricity crisis. And we got a not-so-good answer that we'll cover in another video we had already made about that. We've also started asking tougher questions like why it's taken over 10 years to move this technology from concept to commercial product. We're still waiting for answers on that. If you have any questions you'd like us to ask Saeth Technologies, email me using the address in the description, and I'll pass them along. Or you can also reach out to Max himself on Twitter, or Saeth Technologies on Instagram and Twitter. Let's keep the conversation going.



 70% of the components they're under my name. I'm the person we've designed them according to what I've seen in this period and the calculations that I have done. So the excitement that is caused when they are exposed to a radio frequency... those materials, those components, materials the excitement causes them to generate energy.



 So when energy is generated it goes to what we call a down converter. The down converter then put it into the DC controller. That process is done with a microcontroller though it's technical but I just want people to understand. So from the DC controller the current now is sent to the inverter where it is changed into AC current. So when you talk of the frequency of the machine and the voltage of the machine it is carefully controlled with the computer the microcontroller. So it is just amazing because the the whole machine what it does it is very intelligent we have combined a artificial intelligence we have combined a computer science to make the machine very smart yeah long time to say and the solar panels are more or less in those ranges but the good thing is that when the machine it is maintained ended the maintenance of the machine it is very cheaper because we don't have a machines we don't have consumer boats. So right now we have seen that our machines can be saved is the three times a year depending on how much energy it is produced because it is like calendar service. So three times we see that on the half a megawatt we need about $1,500 per each four months. This is nothing. Then on the battery side because our primary source to switch on the machine comes from a battery. We right now are using lithium and batteries were talking for about 15 to 20 years. So the technology is just sustainable. Yeah while it is maintained you can go for a very long time. Let's talk about your failing to file a patent. That's a very crucial aspect. Okay you know we have got laws. There's a time that I explained on my Facebook page so that people could understand how the laws, the patent laws work. They are patents which are not patentable. Big news Maxwell Chikumbutsu and Saeth Technologies are planning a massive road trip demonstration to prove their microsonic energy device works and we've got the inside scoop. A few days ago we reached out to Saeth Technologies on Instagram to ask about two things. When the highly anticipated road trip demonstration will happen and when their products will finally be available for purchase. To our surprise we got answers and we're going to share a screenshot so you know this isn't just speculation. According to Saeth Technologies they're currently working on organizing a road trip where a vehicle powered by the microsonic energy device will travel embrace the road for the first time for us to see. If you remember on the launch day they said it will be from Harare, Zimbabwe all the way to Egypt. We tried asking for specifics if it will be so but that question has not been answered yet but this demonstration aims to prove that the vehicle can run for hours or even days without needing to stop for fuel or charging. We also inquired whether it will be a live stream and where to stream it but we are still waiting for answers and once we get answers we will update you. But that's not all. When it comes to releasing confirmed and final prices for their products Saeth Technologies has scheduled this for some time in March. This aligns with what Zim Tech guy mentioned earlier about the new website being launched soon which could provide more detailed information about the products pricing and availability. Of course we didn't stop there. Our team member also asked whether the products will be accessible outside Zimbabwe once they're unveiled in March. While we're still waiting for a clear answer on that we'll keep you updated as soon as we hear back. We also inquired about the exact dates for the road trip but that information is still pending. If you have any more information about this maybe questions of your own that you asked Saeth Technologies and got replies from them feel free to share with us via the email in the description. We'll keep you posted as more details emerge. This is a huge step for Maxwell Chicken Butso Insight Technologies. If the road trip demonstration succeeds it could silence skeptics and prove that the microsonic energy device is the real deal. But until then questions remain. Will the vehicle really make it to Egypt without stopping? Will the technology hold up under real world conditions and most importantly will the products be available to the public as promised?
