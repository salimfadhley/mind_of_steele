 The vehicle it uses is looking for the microsonic energy device. Microsonic energy device it is the device that I personally invented in 2009 which harness radio frequencies, conflated into energy and this is the first time in the world. A device that converts radio frequency into energy, giving you unlimited driving range and free power forever. Is that possible?



 Well, those are the bold claims that this Zimbabwean innovator is making.



 If you have ever dreamed of owning a car that never needs fuel or charging then this might be your lucky day. Meet Maxwell Chikunguso, a self-taught inventor from Zimbabwe who claimed to have invented a device that lets you drive your car or power your house without ever needing to visit the gas station or use conventional electricity.



 According to Chikunguso, his car doesn't need to be recharged because it generates its own power using radio waves. He claims that this energy can be converted into electricity allowing the car to run forever.



 He made these claims while he was presenting his inventions to the president of Zimbabwe, Emerson Nangagwa.



 As you know, radio frequencies, they are measured in nano volts meaning to say they are less than a volt, they are just like nothing but we find a way of balancing it through the creation of the 70% of the components in the microsonic energy which I've telomeres to have designed.



 So those are the components that enable the radio frequencies to transfer into pure, useful energy and this is the first time in the world. With that technology to violate the laws of energy in thermodynamics and also the first law of energy as well. According to him, the car was developed in partnership with a Chinese company, Ka'i.



 The company produced the car and Maxwell provided his invention to be integrated into the car, unlocking the free energy potential of the car. Listen to him talk about some of the specs of the car.



 So in this car you can also use it to power your house. It is a moving generator. When you drive from work back to your home, you can connect your power cable, then you can power your house. It gives you 15 kilowatts of power to power your house. Top speed is 220 kmph, which is fast. It has got two driving modes. We have got the sport mode, which will give you 0 to 100 kmph in around 2 seconds. That is very, very powerful. Then you've got what we call a normal driving mode when you want to drive like in town. If this is true, this technology could change the world. It could replace fossil fuels, reduce pollution and bring electricity to remote areas.



 Transportation would be cheaper. Businesses could run more efficiently and people wouldn't have to worry about fuel or electricity costs.



 It could lead to new inventions and change how we live.



 But for such a big claim to be believed, it needs strong scientific proof and real world demonstrations. This is not the first time Shkombuso has made such bold claims. In the past, he unveiled a series of inventions through his company, State Technologies, including a TV that powers itself and a generator that he claims produces electricity using radio frequencies.



 According to him, these ideas are revealed to him spiritually. God has given me something that is going to change the world. His claims were so bold that it attracted international attention. Two experts from the United States traveled to Zimbabwe to assess his free energy generator. After their assessment, this is what they had to say. One final check of the battery voltage revealed a shocking result. Not only had the machine outlasted the expected battery life, but the batteries were still fully charged.



 This proved that the device was being powered from an unknown energy source.



 Coming back to his recent invention, the self-powered car. The news has been received with mixed reactions. While some people were excited about the potential of this technology, others have questioned its legitimacy, with comments like, "We need a video showing someone driving it for 450 miles nonstop and repeat the journey without charging. Only then will people believe it's a free energy vehicle with unlimited driving range." Another comment wrote, "Dodgy. Very dodgy. You cannot create energy out of nothing."



 A user on X even challenged him by writing the following, "I want to challenge Maxwell Sangulani to kunguso, working with all curious engineers and media people, to drive his vehicle that uses perpetual energy and doesn't need charging, motary to Victoria Falls and back to prove his devious and preposterous claims. I will pay the costs. It's okay to fool others, but he must not drag the president into his mischief."



 So, are Maxwell's inventions real or scam? To answer this, let's take a look at my findings and I'll let you draw your own conclusions.



 First of all, Maxwell's kunguso presented a device that he claimed to have invented.



 However, I did a quick reverse image search and found an exact match being sold on Amazon under a different name.



 Nowhere in the product listing does it mention Maxwell or his company, said technologist. If this is truly his invention, why is it already being sold online by another manufacturer?



 Secondly, there was no demonstration of this technology. One of the biggest red flags is the lack of a public demonstration. Maxwell has made some incredible claims about this self-powered car, yet he hasn't provided any solid proof that this technology actually works. For such a bold claim, one would expect him to at least drive the car for a significant distance without stopping to recharge or refuel. A simple real-world test like this would go a long way in convincing people about the legitimacy of his invention. Without it, skepticism remains.



 Maxwell also claimed that he tried to file a patent for his invention, but it was denied. If Maxwell's technology was truly groundbreaking, why was he denied a patent? According to him, it was denied because it defies the laws of physics. Even when we tried to file a patent, they said they were violating the laws of physics, so it's not an industrial applicable. The fact that no patent exists raises serious doubts.



 The last interesting finding I made is that Maxwell claimed he developed the car in partnership with the Chinese automaker, Ka'i. However, after checking their official website and social media accounts, I found no mention of any collaboration with him. Normally, when a company is involved in a groundbreaking innovation like this, they proudly announce it. But in this case, Ka'i has remained completely silent about any partnership with Maxwell or his self-powered car. This raises the question, was this partnership real or was it just another unverified claim? So what do we make of all this? On one hand, free energy technology would be a game changer for the world. It would eliminate fuel costs, reduce pollution and make electricity accessible to everyone. This is why people want to believe in inventions like this so bad. On the other hand, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. So far, Maxwell has not provided solid scientific evidence to back up this invention. There are no independent tests and no patents to verify his technology.



 Now, I am not an expert, so this is just my findings based on what I have researched. Is Maxwell Chukunbusto a brilliant inventor ahead of his time or is this just another scam?
