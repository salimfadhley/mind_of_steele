 Welcome everyone to a DB official product demonstration. After years of development, we finally unveil in the world's first commercially viable nanodiamond battery. What you're looking at is not just a battery, it's a tiny nuclear generator that converts radiation from nuclear waste into usable electricity for our patented diamond nuclear-voltage technology. I'm proud to announce that we've overcome the power output challenges that limited earlier proto-tets. All our first generation consumer devices will last approximately a decade. Our industrial versions leverage radioactive isotopes with extremely long half-lives, potentially providing power for up to 28,000 years without maintenance or recharging. The DNV stacks you see here combine semiconductor, metal and ceramic materials to form power generation units. Between these layers are radio isotopes that release radiation upon decay. This radiation is then inelastically scattered in single crystalline diamond to generate electrical charges. The entire structures are only 40 micrometres in size but connected together they create substantial power output. As director of innovation at Tech Future Robotics, I have a pressing question about safety. These batteries essentially contain radioactive materials, how can you assure consumers and manufacturers that there's no radiation risk when integrated into everyday devices or autonomous robots? Excellent question. Safety is our paramount concern. The diamond encapsulator contains radiation within the device. These DNV stacks are coated with polycrystalline diamond that's approximately 12 times stronger than stainless steel. We've also incorporated nanolayers of chromium and lead in a hole in cap structure that captures radiation, keeping levels close to background radiation. Additionally, we use born-doped single crystalline diamond to convert extra neutrons into alpha rays and our proprietary locking system restricts the usage of the nuclear material to power generation only, preventing any proliferation risks. The environmental benefits are equally impressive. These batteries produce zero emissions during operation, are inert to the environment and don't require cobalt mining addressing ethical concerns associated with conventional lithium ion production. Most importantly, we recycle dangerous nuclear waste into useful power sources. I've been covering energy technology for Global Tech Journal for 15 years and I'm intrigued by your claims. However, your air-lire prototypes in 2020 produced only microwatts from a gram of carbon minus 14. How have you scaled power output to make this commercially viable for applications beyond tiny sensors?



 You're right to be skeptical.



 Our breakthrough came in late 2023 when we developed a new configuration of the DNV stacks that significantly increased power density. We've now achieved power output suitable for consumer electronics, medical implants and even modular configurations for larger applications. While we're not yet powering electric vehicles with a single battery, our roadmap has clear milestones for scaling up. This is genuinely exciting for the robotics industry. Current limitations in battery technology have restricted autonomous robots to either short operational periods or complex self-charging mechanisms. With this technology, we could potentially develop systems that operate for decades without power concerns transforming fields from agricultural robots to space exploration rovers. I'm particularly interested in how these batteries might integrate with AI systems. One of our biggest challenges with deploying advanced AI in remote locations is power consumption. Could your technology enable truly distributed AI networks for environmental monitoring or communication systems in underdeveloped regions? Absolutely. We're already working with several AI companies to develop integrated systems. Imagine environmental sensors powered by NDB technology that could operate for decades in remote rainforests or ocean depths, continuously gathering and processing data through integrated AI. Or medical implants that not only power themselves but contain AI systems that adapt to the patient's changing physiology. Let's address the elephant in the room cost. Previous estimates suggested these batteries would be prohibitively expensive for mass market adoption. What's your current pricing structure and when might we see this technology reach price parity with conventional batteries? Our initial products will target high value applications where long term reliability outweighs upfront cost to medical devices, critical infrastructure monitoring, aerospace and military applications. You're right that we're not yet competitive with conventional batteries for everyday consumer electronics but our economies of scale are improving rapidly. We project price parity for many applications by 2030. One final question, what happened to end of life? Even with decade long consumer versions eventually these will need disposal. Are we just creating a different kind of waste problem? We've designed our consumer products with full life cycle management in mind. Each battery has a unique identifier and tracking system. When performance degrades customers return them to us for refurbishment or proper recycling. The diamond structures remain valuable and the radioactive materials can be reprocessed for new batteries. Nothing goes to landfill. Today marks just the beginning of the nano diamond battery revolution. We're already working with partners across automotive, aerospace, medical and EOT sectors to integrate this technology. By this time next year you'll see NDEB powered devices and commercial applications and within five years we believe this technology will fundamentally change how we think about energy storage and distribution. As someone who's been waiting for a solution like this I believe we're witnessing a pivotal moment in technological history. If NDEB can deliver on these promises we're looking at the enablement of entirely new categories of autonomous systems and AI applications that have been impossible until now. My team will be first in line to integrate these into our next generation of environmental monitoring robots. While impressive I will reserve final judgment until we see widespread deployment and independent verification of these claims. That said the potential impact on everything from medical devices to space exploration is undeniable. If this technology proves as revolutionary as suggested today we may indeed be witnessing the beginning of a new era in energy technology one that could help address both our energy needs and nuclear waste challenges simultaneously.
