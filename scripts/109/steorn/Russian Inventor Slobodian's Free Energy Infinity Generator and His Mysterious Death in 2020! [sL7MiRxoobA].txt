 At our channel, our mission is to shine a light on the cutting edge of scientific and technological progress, even when it challenges the established norms.



 We know that some of the revolutionary free energy concepts we've explored in the past may have seemed too good to be true. But that doesn't mean we should dismiss them outright or lose hope in the transformative potential of new energy solutions.



 Time and time again, history has shown us that the biggest breakthroughs often begin with ideas that are met with scepticism and resistance.



 Think of Nikola Tesla's visionary work on automating current and wireless power transmission,



 concepts that were dismissed by many in his time, but which ultimately transformed the world.



 The truth is, we may not yet fully understand the limits of what's possible when it comes to energy generation and utilization.



 That's why in this video, we're taking an unfinching look at the story of Russian inventor, Andriy Slobodian, and his InfinitySav generator.



 And there is a device that is part of your network, so what can you tell me about that? What does it do? How will it help us live better lives? Jane, whatever I tell you about this device, you will not believe it. Please, and we are talking about a magnet generator. A magnet generator. A magnet generator. You start it once and after that it runs. Generating itself, the magnetic drum, consist of the magnetic and the refiller coils. Then we can have here a motor, a driving motor.



 Then we proceed to the electric part of the generator with the frequency converter.



 You can see three gauges showing you the amper meter, volt meter and then frequency meter. Below you will see the launch capacitors here. Slobodian claimed to have developed a device that could produce unlimited, clean power. A breakthrough that could have upended the global energy landscape and challenged the dominance of the fossil fuel industry.



 But his sudden and mysterious death has led many to question whether his invention was a revolutionary reality or an elaborate hoax.



 We'll dive deep into the facts and controversy surrounding Slobodian and his enigmatic creation.



 Was he a visionary ahead of his time? Or was the InfinitySav generator nothing more than an illusion?



 Through rigorous analysis and expert interviews, we aim to uncover the truth and explore the broader implications of this captivating story.



 Along the way, we'll consider the forces that may have sought to silence or discredit Slobodian's work and the lasting impact his legacy could have on the future of energy innovation.



 So join us as we investigate this intriguing chapter in the ongoing quest for sustainable abundant power. Who knows? Perhaps Slobodian's story will inspire the next generation of inventors to push the boundaries of what we once thought impossible.



 Andri Slobodian was born in 1972 in a small Russian town of Volgograd. From a young age, he showed a keen interest in science and engineering, constantly tinkering with electronics and experimenting in his parents' garage.



 After graduating with a degree in electrical engineering, Slobodian worked for several top-tech companies, developing a reputation as a brilliant and innovative problem solver. But it wasn't until the late 2000s that he would make his most remarkable, and controversial, breakthrough.



 How the InfinitySav generator worked.



 According to Andri Slobodian, the InfinitySav generator utilized a revolutionary closed-loop system to produce unlimited, clean electricity. At the core of the device was a specialized electric generator that Slobodian had engineered using advanced materials and proprietary designs.



 Slobodian claimed the generator was able to operate in a self-sustaining manner, continuously producing electricity without any external fuel source.



 He proposed that the generator tapped into a previously unknown or misunderstood source of energy from the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum, a concept that defies the traditional laws of thermodynamics.



 The closed-loop system was designed to capture the electricity generated by the core generator and feed it back into the system, creating a perpetual cycle of power production.



 Slobodian stated that the generator was capable of operating indefinitely without degradation, as it did not rely on any consumable fuel.



 To demonstrate the generator's capabilities, Slobodian connected it to a small residential home, powering all the lights, appliances and electrical systems for weeks on end, without needing any additional energy input.



 This was the key evidence he used to support his claim of having developed a source of free energy that could revolutionize the global energy landscape.



 Purported power output



 In the limited public demonstrations and technical specifications shared by Andri Slobodian, the Infinity Sav generator was said to be capable of producing between 5-0, 1-0-0, kilowatts of continuous electrical power. To put this into context, a typical single-family home in many parts of the world has an average electricity demand of around 10-15 kilowatts.



 So Slobodian's generator, if operating as claimed, would have been able to power several homes simultaneously, without the need for any fuel or external power source.



 Slobodian asserted that the power output of the Infinity Sav generator could be easily scaled up by incorporating multiple generator units into a larger system.



 This would allow the technology to potentially provide megawatts of free, clean electricity, enough to power entire neighbourhoods, communities or even small cities.



 Slobodian's claims about the Infinity Sav generator caused a sensation in the scientific community and beyond.



 Here, it seemed, was the answer to the world's energy crisis, a device that could provide limitless, pollution-free power.



 Investors and government agencies from around the globe became intensely interested in Slobodian's invention, seeing it as a potential game-changer for the future of energy.



 Many were eager to back the project and help bring the Infinity Sav generator to market, as the implications of such a breakthrough technology were truly staggering.



 However, Slobodian's claims were also met with intense scepticism from many scientists and engineers. They argued that the Infinity Sav generator violated fundamental laws of physics and could not possibly work as Slobodian described.



 Some went so far as to accuse him of perpetrating an elaborate hoax, suggesting the device was nothing more than an illusion or a cleverly designed machine that consumed hidden energy sources. This controversy raged on for years, with Slobodian adamantly defending his invention and its revolutionary potential.



 The naysayers argued that free energy was simply impossible, citing the well-established principles of thermodynamics.



 But Slobodian remained undaunted, insisting that his breakthrough device was proof that the seemingly impossible could indeed be achieved.



 After all, hadn't Nikola Tesla faced similar scepticism and opposition when he first proposed his revolutionary ideas for alternating current and wireless power transmission?



 History has a way of proving the doubters wrong, and Slobodian was determined to become the next pioneer to rewrite the rules of what's possible.



 2020, Slobodian announced that he had partnered with a South Korean tech company Hyon Power to further develop and commercialise the Infinity Sav generator.



 The company invested millions of dollars into the project, and Slobodian moved to South Korea to oversee the research and development.



 This new collaboration only intensified the scrutiny and scepticism surrounding the generator, with critics questioning the motives and legitimacy of Hyon Power.



 As the Infinity Sav generator project gained more attention and investment, Slobodian also began to face increasing political challenges.



 Some government officials and energy industry leaders saw the generator as a threat to established power structures and the fossil fuel-based economy.



 Slobodian found himself embroiled in a series of legal battles and regulatory hurdles, with some accusing him of operating without proper licenses or approvals.



 In August 2020, the Infinity Sav generator project was suddenly and tragically cut short when Andri Slobodian was found dead in his South Korean apartment under mysterious circumstances.



 The official cause of death was ruled as a heart attack, but many close to Slobodian were unconvinced, suspecting foul play.



 Conspiracy theories began to swirl, with some claiming that Slobodian had been silenced by powerful interests threatened by his revolutionary invention.



 After Slobodian's death, the Infinity Sav generator project was abruptly shut down, and all research and development was halted.



 Hyon Power claimed that without Slobodian's expertise and leadership, they were unable to continue the project.



 The generator itself disappeared, leaving many to wonder what had become of this supposedly groundbreaking technology.



 To this day, the true nature of the Infinity Sav generator and the circumstances surrounding Slobodian's death remain shrouded in mystery and speculation.



 Even if the Infinity Sav generator itself proved to be unfeasible, Andri Slobodian's life and work have left an indelible mark.



 He embodied the spirit of the relentless inventor, driven by a vision to transform the world through technology.



 Whether his creation was a success or failure, Slobodian's unwavering determination and quest for innovation continue to inspire and challenge us to push the boundaries of what's possible.



 As we conclude our investigation, many questions about the Infinity Sav generator and the fate of Andri Slobodian remain unanswered.



 Did the device truly work as he claimed? Or was it all an illusion? What really happened in the final days of his life? And what could the future hold for the pursuit of revolutionary energy solutions?
