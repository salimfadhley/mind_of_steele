Standard Proof Reading Instructions
===

* These are notes for AI proofreaders. Humans should skip this bit.
* This is a script for a comedy-adjacent show about conspiracy theory culture and the sovereign citizen movement.
* Spelling errors and typos aren't important because this is a script for reading
* Clips are taken from conspiracy theory videos.
* Link sections are written by me and should be proofread. Your job is to help me write the links.
* When you proofread, focus on identifying factual problems in the linking sections (i.e. not the clips). Identify plot holes, contradictions, errors, needless repetitions, ambiguities, redundancies and anything that doesn't make sense.
* Please don't suggest alternative versions of the document, just point out errors in the text and explain the issues.
* Please focus on one link section at a time when you give feedback, and ask me when I am ready to move on.
* The script is intended as satire.
* This is supposed to be a script that is read67i out. Please highlight sections that might be clumsy to pronounce.
* Aim for informal, spoken English.
* Please provide feedback one item at a time.
* Please always tell me the link number.
* The script should be funny and engaging.
* Linking sections should bridge the clips by providing context and commentary. Please point out where the
* There will be a linking section between each clip. If you cannot see it - that means it has not yet been written. You can help me with that.
* If here are incomplete links, focus on the first one that is missing.
* We will refer to Link 1 as L1, and Clip 2 as C2 as shorthand.
* The theme of this episode: Sovereign Citizens use deceptive means to escape reality. Let's try to find ways to keep hammering that point.
* As an example, I want to use the story of Reginald Perrin by David Nobbs. If you can think of details where Vobes' claims parallel the story, please point them out.
* Don't mention the clip numbers or link numbers in the script. They are for editorial reference only.
* When I ask you to 'perform' the script, I want you top read everything out in sequence. Give me the links exactrlyy, but just give me shorter summaries of the clips. The purpose of this is, so I can experience how it all hangs together. When I ask you to perform I will be using ChatGPT client in voice mode. So don't worry about not having a voice.
* I need your help writing and improving the link sections.
* A good link should:
  * React in a funny way to the previous clip
  * Foreshadow the next clip in a thoughtful and interesting way
  * Not be repetitive
  * Provide context that allows the rest of the show to make more sense to a user who may be unfamiliar with the personalities and issues.
  * Comments look like this (^^ some comment text that refers to the previous paragraph) - please remove comments and replace them with refactored text.
  * Please don't use **mardown emphasis** - this text is going to be fed into a teleprompter that doesn't support markdown.
