 Good morning ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Naked Englishman. I'm Richard Bove, this is the Audio Darrow in my life, it's the 13th of February today, 2025 and guess what, another overcast, cloudy, sunless day.



 Recognizing a pattern, I don't know how many times I have to say this now, surely people can start to see it, surely, I said this yesterday,



 but it seems not, it seems not.



 I'm gonna make myself a cup of coffee, yesterday I had a day, I did an interview,



 round about four, no two-ish it was,



 which was good to get back to doing, you know, some of them, it's cold in the studio, that's one of the reasons I don't want to do many in the winter period, in the summer period, of course if we do get any sunshine, my god, and they're gonna need to get out there and get some of that sunshine.



 I need to go and flush my eye actually,



 it's just after eight o'clock instantly, I need to flush my eye out because, my false eye,



 because it's a little painful this morning, the crystals of over night time have got in there and



 so let me just bung you up here and see if I can get some warm warm water, I had this, the Ession, I just give it a bit of a,



 in fact I will take it out, let's put the plug in, it will be disappearing down the plug hole,



 give it a wash,



 some people don't know that you can take these false eyes out,



 it's a shell-like thing, it's not a big ram ball, so there is a plastic ball in my skull,



 where, not quite sure how big it is, they did show me what they were going to put in and they put that in, wrap the muscle around it and then what's left, they take an impression of, like on a dentist's mouth thing, same sort of pug and then they mold the prosthesis, which is a piece of acrylic I think,



 I just can't, there's a bit there, it's hanging down, I can't quite get it to crystallise stuff right on the eyelid, so I have a hole in my eye at the moment,



 I need to get one of those ear pokers,



 put my eye down, out of the way, sorry about this and I just need to, out,



 because it's not like, hang on, I've got a bit of it, it's not like when your eye is actually in the socket, so I've got, it's just this piece of crystallised, whatever you call it, sleep, I suppose,



 did I get it?



 And then bits of that, yeah it's gone good, start to irritate the eye and it weeps and all of those things, anyway the muscle behind I'm just able to see now, all looks very good, so that's all good,



 and I'll just give the eye a bit of a clean,



 and then put it back in, to say about the,



 slide it in like a contact lens, there you go, warmed it up as well,



 because in the winter it gets cold,



 obviously, but you know an eye, an ordinary, an eye is part of the body, so it doesn't ordinarily get cold, it gets cold from the winds and things, this gets cold from the winds but the hole, because it's not part of me and because it's acrylic and you know basically plastic, it gets cold, you feel it, you feel it, this cold lump in your head, it is quite bizarre, but it warms up with you of course, anyway enough about that, that's all a bit queasy, we'll make a cup of coffee, I started from the beginning yesterday and worked through the book, didn't get very far because my prose and my ability to write prose is not you know not great, well it's challenging, let's just put it like that, it's a challenge, it's a real challenge, when you read other people's work you probably erroneously think that they just sit at the typewriter and type away and what they type is what's printed, in other words that they are,



 it just streams out of them without any effort, of course that's most unlikely to be true,



 unless they have been writing for years and concentrated on writing and have developed not only the ability to select the right words but to have a vast,



 oh I had the word now, vocabulary, thank you, a vast vocabulary and also a turn of phrase in a way of describing things, and the trouble is you can't compare yourself to somebody who has been published and been doing it for a long time, you know somebody who's really good at it, you can't do that because, well A it's silly and B, oh what was that, something's just fallen out the fridge, what is that,



 oh it's just a fridge magnet came off,



 yeah so it's silly, and of course they've been doing it a long time, get this coffee going,



 so anyway I did do that and it just took a long time to get to a point where, is it flowing, is it flowing, would the reader get, oh they'll really understand, or does the reader trip over the words, have I, I keep looking at it and trying to make it okay, it hasn't got to be a work of genius, that's the thing, it hasn't got but I just want it, you know that sort of thing like with music, you don't want bum notes, you know what I push,



 you want feeding,



 of course he says, of course, I'm a bit later tonight, I woke up, the alarm went off, where's your food gone, here it is, the alarm went off and I went back to sleep because I was a bit tired, I waited up a little bit too late because I was working on this book and, oh one thing and another, anyway, what is the temperature, it's warmer in here today you have to say, even though I've got a big jumper, it's actually warmer but it's gonna be colder if you light the fire again,



 and now I did an interview with a woman who was talking about,



 well she was sexually assaulted, but she doesn't really talk about that because that was in the newspapers at the time by an MP, she was sexually assaulted and Andrew Bridgen helped her at the time and, but her main thing is she was a parliamentary researcher, a senior parliamentary researcher and she knew and knows the inner workings of how Parliament operates and so she is amazed, not, well made is perhaps not the right word, but dismayed that,



 and I did a little video about this, that reform and not mentioning the jabs being all very populist and she had a bit of inside information to impart, so that will go out, probably go out this morning, it saves me during the monologue,



 because it's it's getting on, I've got an interview at eight o'clock tonight with somebody called Mr. Beer guy,



 he's got evidence about council tax and stuff,



 yes a few people have asked me what are you going to do about the council taxes this time around in terms of content on the show and that is a legitimate question,



 let me just get in the other room, you're all right Puss you've got all you need, do you, you don't, you're not nagging to go out so I'm not going to open the back door quite yet,



 so that is a, yes I want to see what happens if, if and when my council tax bill comes, it may come, but I did it very differently to everybody else and it never, I never got, I never got the bill in the end, I mean I never got summons, I got summons I never turned up and I never got a liability order and I never got anybody visiting me,



 so they did send me the liability order,



 sorry I'm all over the bloody place this morning aren't I, not coherently thinking, I do apologize, this does seem to be a recurring, it must be the age you know what I mean, that's what they're spraying in the skies, they did send me a summons,



 I'd invoiced them, I invoiced them and they sent me a summons, but I had paid it with the bill of exchange,



 so I did that but then they sent me the summons and so I said, I wrote three letters, I'm sure I've told you this but I wrote three letters, one to the, one to them, because it wasn't from the courts this summons, I said, this is, I wrote to them and said hey I think there's a scam going on, this is very strange, I've got a letter to go to court, but you know what, it's not on court paper, it doesn't have a court stamp, it's not signed by a judge and it tells me I have to contact the prosecutor, not the claimant, before I can actually go to court, I said that's a bit weird isn't it, so I wrote to them, I also wrote to the court, the clerk of the court said exactly the same, I said I think this is a scam, you better look into this, I think this is a scam, somebody is operating a scam and then I, so with all the same points and I wrote to the Attorney General and said hey I think there's a scam going on down in West Sussex, I mean I just played a bit ignorant really, you know, as if,



 I said I don't think this is real, this doesn't look legit,



 you better look into it and bringing it to your attention because obviously you want the laws got to be done and it's got to be seen to be done and I heard nothing, I didn't attend the, as I said, I didn't attend the fake court and I heard nothing,



 so that's interesting,



 I did pay the Southern Water with the signature, you know, the Bill of Exchange signature thing and then I made my video Bloody Works,



 second time I signed it for the Southern Water thing,



 they hounded me saying no, no, you can't pay that way, you can't pay that way, they hounded me for money, it was only 50 quid, they hounded me and then I got several letters for 50 quid and 50, another 50 quid and I couldn't work out whether it was several 50 quids or what it was that they were after, the first one that I actually paid it for was 300 pounds,



 anyway,



 I mean I don't know whether they float that and then can make millions out of it, out of the signature, so in theory you could argue that I don't need to pay for water ever again, thank you very much, because they've got my signature on a bit of paper which if it's traded,



 I don't know if that's the case, that may not be, it may be they just got the 300 quid that they were after,



 but anyway they were hounding me with their letters to pay up, pay up, pay up, so I was advised by somebody who knows much better than I do, he said try this, just write on it, the person you're writing to is deceased, so I did that, I just wrote on the bill and sent it back, said the person you're writing to is deceased, which is a true statement of course,



 because they're writing to a dead entity aren't they, they're writing to the name, the corporate name, but of course they thought,



 I get this letter then from an estate bailiff,



 debt collector, I've seen that, nicey-nicey it is, we're so sorry to hear about the passing of Mr Vobes, we're so sorry to contact you at this terrible time, blah blah blah, but there's 50 quid you owe us, so if you'd see your way to doing it, and then I had a letter from Southern Water saying you know we've passed this on to this, so sorry for your passing, blah blah blah, but it's to the executive, sorry the executor of the late



 Mr Richard Vobes, which now,



 one could claim to be the executor if one wanted to, and then say you know pay off the bills for probate, or one can say well it isn't me, which it isn't really, it isn't me, and simply say no that's not me, I don't know who that is, so I'm not answering it, which is my stance, because if it's not actually me, which it isn't, who are they writing to now, so when the,



 yeah so who knows what will happen next, also they've written to my government address,



 my house you know, the what I used to think was my house with the postcode and a number on the door, because I no longer have a number on the door, and I don't use the postcode, so if somebody knocks on the door and says are you so and so, no, ah, is this number whatever,



 no this is, I've changed the name you see, it's Biggleswick House, no no this is Biggleswick House, sorry, did you, can I help you, well I'm looking for, yeah doesn't live here, sorry about that mate,



 if you could stop your letters coming here that would be great, bye-bye, and shut the door, if I, if I bother to answer the door,



 people don't seem to realise how actually important the name thing is,



 somebody email me, says Richard I don't quite, I forget who it was, he says I understand the principle but I don't know you know how we use it,



 and I do need to go through this,



 how are we doing on time, I mean the name, you know the name is being created, your mum, when you're born,



 your mum and dad give you a name don't they, they call you Reggie, I'm going to call him Reggie, it's a nice, he looks like Reggie, and their surname might be Perrin, so you would think then that he's going to be Reggie Perrin, and they trot down to the registry office and they say under the fear of threats remember that you know if you don't register your child they're going to threaten you with money, and we all told you've got to do it, you've got to do it, and you can see some reasons for doing it, that they can have a list, an index of people, so it's just useful in many ways as an administration, I absolutely get that, I get that it's nice, it's useful,



 but under the fear of we'll find you if you don't and that you have to do it, I think is perfectly wrong, anyway you go in, you inform, I mean they say it, the informant is usually a mum and dad, and they say my son is called Reggie okay, and they take the surname, Perrin, and they create this birth certificate, you know, and but what they've actually done now



 is they go ahead,



 copyright your name, tell you it's it, you grow up thinking you're Reggie Perrin,



 you're trained at school that you're Reggie Perrin,



 you apply for a, you get a national insurance number in the name of Reggie Perrin, you get a bank account blah blah blah, all the utility bills you know you get married under the name Reggie Perrin etc.



 This name is not you is it, I mean and this is the fundamental thing, it's just a name somebody's registered, you're using it and these and you can open a bank account and what have you and I've gone through how the certificate is not any proof that it's you, how can it be, it's just a piece of paper, it can't be any evidence, how can a piece of paper with words on it evidence be proof that it means you, it cannot, but we are so brainwashed, cleverly, cleverly, I mean whoever thought of that thought well we brainwash these people so they think that that name is them because it's only a label, it's only a label, so we, so in other words we step into this labels world which is an identical world to the real world only it's all on paper so that name Reggie Perrin is just a name that is used in a paper world to set up bank accounts to you know have a passport and all that but the real man or woman the real Reggie Perrin as it were the real man he's he's he can call himself Reggie Perrin if he wants to and he can call himself Reggie or he can call himself Rebecca he can call himself whatever he wants you know he can have a completely different name and identity if you like where it so that's you know that's how we all get it we all believe with this thing but we've got to separate ourselves like an actor playing a part like Leonard Rosseter is not really Reggie Perrin but in the world of Reggie Perrin uh he is Reggie Perrin he's not Leonard Rosseter and that's what we have to do so um you know I'm I'm separated the real me is separated from Richard Vobes that Leonard Rosseter who's now dead of course but he was separated from Reggie Perrin it was just a part we're all playing this part when we use the name that we think is us on the Crown corporate birth certificate so all the utility bills the bank accounts everything goes to this act part this character which isn't us also in other words everything goes to Reggie Perrin it doesn't go to Leonard Rosseter but if Leonard Rosseter doesn't understand that it goes to him and he's he just carries on playing Reggie Perrin when he doesn't need to so the the now some will say the beauty of this is that you can pick up the character of Reggie Perrin so Leonard Rosseter can go do you know what I want to heat the house turn on the heating and then the bill comes but he's got it in the name of Reggie Perrin so he goes down to the you know electricity shop and he says oh hello I'm Reggie Perrin can I have some electricity they say yeah here it is he puts it he pays for it if you if you like as Reggie Perrin and he goes home and but he's actually heating up Leonard Rosseter's house and Leonard Rosseter is getting warm but let's say the bill comes in later and it flops down and he notices well I'm I'm I'm Leonard Rosseter what's this bill here to Reggie Perrin how can Reggie Perrin pay it unless I step into that character well I don't want to step into that I don't have to step into that character because that character is just you know it's like having a bill going it arrives to your house and it's it's dear William Shakespeare and it flops on you'd go well that's not me is it why would I pay that dear Sherlock Holmes uh could you pay up this bill and you go but that's not me so I am very tempted to I mean I and then you know they'll come knocking on the door you said well we've got this bill to Shakespeare uh William Shakespeare you haven't paid it we said well I'm not William Shakespeare and then they you know they try and badger you and say but you are because you you live at this address and you go no I live at a different address to what you've got written down there um your address goes to a point on a map on a bit of paper in your office doesn't go to a real home doesn't go to a real home where a living being is but you think it does because we've put numbers and we put this postcode and you've allocated on the map that that's where it is but we I'm actually in the real world you're on a fake world I mean I'm on the earth um anyway I've got on about this far too long I didn't mean to so um in in some ways I think that you could defeat them if all these bills come in you just send it to the Crown Corporation say oh this came for you



 you know this uh Reggie Perry name that you've um done has come to you you send it to the to the Crown Corporation which is in the centre of London in the city of London in a foreign state sorry this is in your registered name the thing you've created so I don't need to pay it you pay it because if you did that of course they'll probably soon cut you off because they're so well we're not we're not allowing Reggie Perry to keep having fuel or to heat his house or water or have a bank account they'll probably just shut you down because they'll go uh-oh that real man or woman has actually twigged and now we're getting the bill I mean they'd have to pay it I assume but um they they would have to foot the bill because they would realize oh yes this is our product this is our thing but I think that's a good way to think about it when something comes to what you think is you and your all caps name your birth name the name on your utility bills and and all of that it comes to you imagine that it is like getting a letter to William Shakespeare are you William Shakespeare no you're not are you Sherlock Holmes no you're not



 am I Richard Vobes no I'm not you know what are you ask yourself what are you you are a soul in a body that's that's all you are you are some form of consciousness in a physical body and when you're awake you're in a a realm that is on the earth you're not in their world their world is a paper trail world it is a different world we have been dupes for so long so the question is what do you do about it well there are lots of you know there are lots of little tricks isn't there but ultimately you say well this isn't your writing to so I've you know you're writing to the wrong person so one could say I think this might be for me this might be for me if you want to write to me just write to my Christian name well I can't they can't they have to have the surname to keep in the jurisdiction you see because it's all commerce and you're in the private and the commerce cannot interact with the private so the invisible world can't work with the real the visible world so you have to be invisible to be in the invisible world if you see what I mean it's like you have to be made of oil to talk to other oil snakes you can't be made of water you know to talk to oil that they don't mix and that's the difference if you are a soul with say just a Christian name or just one name not using the not using the name they've created that's why you can't mix it because their world of commerce their world of commerce has to do with other businesses it can't deal with people real people and that's where they get they get stuck and I hope I've made that a bit clearer but it's I've gone on a bit and it's very easy to get you know over man man explain as they say anyway till next time thanks for listening
