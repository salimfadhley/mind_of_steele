He Faked His Own Death to Avoid a Gas Bill
===

Link 1: There's a white window-envelope lying on the doormat. You know without looking what it will contain: A document demanding money. A payment must be made. It is for the energy or services you have consumed over the last few months. 

Most of us accept this as part of life. You use the energy, you feel the warmth, you pay the bill. It is an eternal cycle. 

But is there any escape? Must it be this way?

Literature is full of people who say no. The people who boldly stand in defiance to the 'norm' and declare their noncompliance.

Tyler Durden rejected consumerism, his own identity, and built an underground anarchist combat cult. 

Reginald Perrin faked his own death by walking into the sea, to escape the drudgery 1970s Britian.

The Buddha renounced his material ties to find the true spiritual bliss.

But what about Richard Vobes?

Not for him wrestling, disappearance or a wilderness journey of self-discovery:

Richard's defiance was far more radical. It began by cancelling his direct debit to Southern Water.

> Clip 1 (Richard Vobes): So I thought right I shut off the direct debit, wrote to the bank, said to the bank no thank you turn that direct debit off. Well within three days I got a bit of paper from my water company going well I notice you've turned off your direct debit you owe us now the whole year in one lump. And I thought right. OK. Do you know what I'll pay it but I'll pay it with my Cestui Que Vie trust.

Link 2: The sovereign citizen movement presents itself as a struggle for freedom, autonomy, and the reclamation of rights.

In reality, it’s something far simpler: a rejection of responsibility—an attempt to reap the benefits of a functioning society without contributing to it. If you don't like paying for your utility bills, your taxes, or your loans, this movement offers you the perfect excuse. It tells you that you can take what you want, but never have to give back.

It’s the adolescent fantasy of nihilist oblivion that Tyler Durden offers in Fight Club. On the surface, his philosophy is about rejecting materialism, tearing down financial institutions, and exposing the illusion of control. But underneath all the rhetoric, what is Tyler really doing? It's pure escapism—to escape their jobs, their obligations, even their own identities. 

The destruction of the system is just a pretext. The real goal? Liberation from personal consequences.

When Richard talks about ‘freedom,’ and 'responsibility' but what he really mean is ‘freedom from paying bills' and other people's responsibility to keep serving him.

> Clip 2 (Richard Vobes): How is that possible you might say. Well it is possible because you can do this. You can do this. So I got the billy doo that came in because it was a bill. A bill. And I said I'll accept this bill this offer as money as pound sterling. And now you take it back and settle the account. And I signed it in a specific way.

This is like Quake's no-clip mode: A financial cheat-code that instead of allowing Richard to phase through walls, can compel somebody else to pay for literally everything.

Even Vobes— an ardent believer in all kinds of nonsense— must have hesitated for a moment: Could it really be this easy? Had he, alone, outwitted the entire financial system with nothing but a blue biro? 

Richard's life experience as a mostly out-of-work actor taught him that money was carefully guarded. People did everything they could do to keep it for themselves... and not give it to him. Vobes was never a fan of hard work, but he knew that even avid fans expected him to do *something* to earn his money.

But this seemed diferent. If this worked, then society, employment and work had all been a needlessly complicated scam.  And, he reasoned, if the water company had stopped chasing him for money then maybe he was onto something? Maybe he wasn't just some deadbeat who forgot to pay his water bill; Maybe he was one of the first to see through the fascade?

Had he discovered a free money supply? The only way to know was to push further. If this trick worked on a water bill, why not apply it to electricity, council tax, and anybody who demanded money?

This in't selfish, he reminded himself. This is for science. 

> Clip 3 (Richard Vobes): And I thought well I'm bloat it bloody well worked and I will do the same on this. And I should probably do the same with my electricity and all other bills and to be honest with you I am experimenting with a number of other bills and I'm waiting to see if they work and I won't say anything if they until they do until they work and I can categorically say to you this works now your water company may be different to my water company may not accept it.

Link 4: Richard has now fully committed to his experiment. What began as words scribbled on an invoice—has, in his mind, transformed into a rigorous research programme. 

Initial results are positive; If it worked once, then could it work again? is this pattern or anomaly?

What are the limitations of this new discovery? What is the underlying mechanism? Could it pay any kind of bill? Electricity? Parking fines? Council tax? Could any demand for money be transmuted from debt to credit, with a few strokes of blue ink?  

And that’s when he spots it: the code. It's been hiding in plain sight this whole time:

Every bill has one. A unique number, or a barcode. Could it be a key to unlocking the secret of this infinite funding glitch?

> Clip 4 (Richard Vobes): So what did I do. Here is an example. Let's have a look. The bill comes in. Now if the bill has as you can see down the bottom here a barcode and often it'll come in as a gyro as it did with mine and it has a barcode. That is the number that accesses the Sester Cave Trust you see.

Link 5: The barcode isn’t just a random number—it is a hidden invitation to a secret financial world; One that ordinary people can never see. This isn’t just a loophole. It’s proof that everything Richard thought he knew about money was a lie. 

And what kind of man, having glimpsed the truth, would just go back to paying his bills?

Richard was not merely as a man trying to pay his bill, but a pioneer; an explorer of arcane financial dimensions. Parallel worlds beyond the grasp of common muggles. This isn't just testing an idea—he’s demonstrating mastery . You're a wizard, Richard!

> Clip 5 (Richard Vobes): So I'm told and what you do is you write on it in blue here as you can see. So in other words it says this bill offer is accepted as money for the in this case dollar amount. I put pound sterling shown here and an arrow goes to the amount that they're asking for in this case it's some five thousand is it what is it eight hundred and sixty four pounds.

Link 6: This has become a ritual. The wording, the placement, even the color of the ink—it all matters. Richard Doesn't yet know why, but his isn't such a strange idea; 

Words have power, he tells himself. Would the Lord's prayer have the same potency if we begged LORD to "forgive our gas bills" or "deliver us from bailiffs".

This isn’t just a transaction; it’s ceremonial and liturgical. Blue ink, specifically, is what gives his words power. Why blue? Who knows… 

The only thing that matters right now is that it works. He's about to have it all. He's victorious, and he intends to win graciously Honorably. 

> Clip 6 (Richard Vobes): Then you sign yours honorably because you want to be honorable the equitable beneficial named estate trust title holder and you sign.

Link 7: But just as Richard thought that he had this whole thing figured out, something completely unexpected happened: It stopped working. 

The company simply says no. Ther rejection was perfunctory, unceremonious. Disrespectful. Incomprehensible. 

The laugh in his face. It's as if to say that Richard Vobes is nothing but a delusional criminal who is attempting to tender worthless scrap paper as a bogus payment for the goods, energy and services he has already consumed.

> Clip 7 (Richard Vobes): so when I did the next one they said no no we don't accept this this isn't payment go away you silly man and and I said well I will go away and I'll pay it another way if you send me back the original financial instrument

Link 8: And just like that, with the press of a button some anonymous office drone they just rejected Richard's payment?

Did they even reflect for a second on the precise meaning of the hand-written note Richard wrote? Explaining that the entire balance outstanding one the might be debited entirely from Richard's Cestui Que Vie trust - the trust that had been set up the moment his birth certificate had been signed, but for unstated reasons kept hidden from him?

Did that jobsworth factotum bother looking up any of the videos that Richard suggested they watch? A series of carefully selected videos on Rumble and Bitchute, made by sensible researchers like Soverign Pete; and explained the origins and secrets of the free money supply?

They cannot have it both ways. They cannot reject his payment, but simultaneously keep it for themselves. Richard knows that this isn’t just a bill—it is a document that has been transfigured by his signature, imbued with real value. 

Richard understands that objects are not always what they appear to be: A communion wafer might be the body of Christ despite appearing to be just a cookie. A heavily inked invoice may appear to be scrap paper, but perhaps the true mystery is the transformation you cannot see.

> Clip 8 (Richard Vobes): and that's why I kept saying I'm happy to pay and I did this with the council tax and HMRC and I did exactly the same they're doing the same and I'm just saying look I'm not saying I'm not paying just give me the financial instrument!

Link 9: If Tyler Durden can make soap from human fat, then why can't Richard Vobes create money from scrap paper? 

But just as Richard’s rebellious confidence reached it's apex, something in his delivery shifted. 

Where once we heard only bravado, we hear a clear undertone of panic. What ended his defiant overconfidence? How did the light that burnt so brightly suddenly burn so pale?

> Clip 9 (Richard Vobes): Hello and welcome to this rather special and somewhat urgent video that I just want to put out there. The other day we had a gentleman on produced a video with me about promissory notes and he said that we can write our own and he gave an example of his.

Link 10: He’s telling people to do their own research. The certainty is gone, replaced by hedging and disclaimers. 

> Clip 10 (Richard Vobes): And because I think people have got to do their own due diligence and not immediately jump on what any of the guests on this show or any other show say.

Link 11: Richard’s sudden caution isn’t just a passing moment—it’s a turning point. He started this journey as a self-assured guide, revealing hidden financial truths to a rapt audience. 

But now, he's pushing them away. He's telling them that all the financial advice he once gave wasn't really advice at all. There's no more bold declaration. It is gone, replaced by hesitation and vague warnings. 

He's stopped telling people to fight the system. Quite the opposite — he’s telling them to be careful. Don’t play with fire. Don't get in trouble. And if you do, don't say you got the idea from me.

And yet, rather than admitting outright that his earlier claims were nonsense, Richard takes the classic conspiracy theorist exit strategy—he urges his audience to think for themselves. If the method works, that’s on them. If it doesn’t? Also on them. 

Richard is telling us that he wants the benefits of being an important thinker within the sovereign citizen movement, but he doesn't want to own the responsibility for his words. 

What could be more perfectly sov-cit than that?

> Clip 11 (Richard Vobes): Thank you so much. I just wanted to put this out in case you have written any of these and before you manage to send them anywhere just to take caution and I appreciate you watching and taking on board these points.

Link 12: The rebel has been chastised. His zeal has drained away, replaced with something unfamiliar.

Doubt. 

Why didn't blue the ink didn’t work. Were the barcodes a red herring? Was he fooling himself the entire time? 

ike an addict at the end of an opium binge, he is twitching and shattered. The walls are closing in. The wolf is at the door. The system hungers. The debt lingers the letters keep piling up. 

Richard is left with only one option—the final escape. To let it all go. The ultimate end his financial burden. An absolute conclusion to the legal threats, and to everything. A terminal full-stop on the prolix sentence of his life. 

It was not his fault. They made him do it.

> Clip 12 (Richard Vobes):But anyway, they were hounding me with their letters to pay up, pay up, pay up. So I was advised by somebody. He said, "Try this. Just write on it. The person you're writing to is deceased." Which is a true statement, of course,

Link 13: Is this the Reginald Perrin phase that I foreshadowed at the start of the show?

Reginald Perrin walked into the sea, shedding his old identity to be reborn as someone new. But Richard Vobes? He doesn’t need such theatrics. No vanishing act, no disguise or fake facial hair. 

He only needs to send one letter, calmly stating that the person the debt collector is demanding money from no longer exists.

> Clip 13 (Richard Vobes): Which is a true statement, of course, because they're writing to a dead entity, aren't they? They're writing to the name, the corporate name.

Link 14: Richard has spent this entire journey seeking financial truth. He is not just a man, but the equitable beneficial named estate trust title holder, a being unburdened by the illusions of commerce. 

His past attempts to engage with the system—through blue ink, barcodes, were but the fumbling efforts of an unenlightened mind, still tethered to material concerns.

But now, Richard sees clearly. That legal fiction—was never real to begin with. So why engage? Why resist? The truest act of sovereignty is not to fight the illusion, but to let it pass through you like mist on a mountaintop. 

Richard renounced not just his financial obligations, but his very existence. If he is not there, then who is left to pay?

> Clip 14 (Richard Vobes): I get this letter then from an estate bailiff. "We're so sorry to hear about the passing of Mr. Vobes. We're so sorry to contact you at this terrible time." But there's 50 quid you owe us.

Link 15: Richard has finally stumbled upon a foolproof way to make the debt disappear: just pay it. 

If he settles the bill, then it no longer matters that he pretended to be dead. The paperwork, the deception — none of it will matter anymore, because there will be no debt left to argue over.

And for an instant, it seems he's actually considering it. It's not so much an abandonment of his beliefs, but a clearing of the table. An opportunity to never has to deal with these letters again: To make it all go away.

> Clip 15 (Richard Vobes): But it's to the executor of the late Mr. Richard Vobes. One could claim to be the executor if one wanted to pay off the bills.

Link 16: For a fleeting moment, Richard considered the most effective and boring solution—paying the bill. But that would mean acknowledging defeat, and that’s not how a sovereign citizen thinks. 

If the system foolish enough to misconstrue Richard's a nuanced letter to mean that he is deceased, then chase a ghost for their money.

Since Richard isn’t actually dead, and therefore cannot be the executor of his own estate, he can now ignore any mail addressed to that non-existent person. 

> Clip 16 (Richard Vobes): Or one can say, "Well, it isn't me." Which it isn't really. It isn't me. And simply say, "No, that's not me." I don't know who that is, so I'm not answering it. Which is my stance. Because if it's not actually me, which it isn't, who knows what will happen next?

Link 17: And here’s the best part: it worked.

Unlike his last two failed schemes, this time there’s no rejection letter, no water company refusing his scribbled-on invoice.

The bills are still arriving, but they aren’t addressed to him anymore—so as far as Richard is concerned, they don’t exist. He isn’t just dodging debt; he’s transcended it.

So, whose opt-out did Richard Vobes’ strategy most resemble?

Did he embrace anger, anarchy, and man-on-man wrestling like Tyler Durden?

Did he stage a dramatic disappearance, leaving behind only a pile of clothes and a mystery, like Reginald Perrin?

Or did he grow beyond the demands of the material world, rejecting earthly obligations in pursuit of a higher truth, like the Buddha?

Perhaps it is the latter—because, despite everything, the bills still keep coming. The debts remain, the letters pile up, and Richard may well have committed a false representation intended to obtain a financial benefit, contrary to the Fraud Act 2006. 

But none of that matters to him anymore. He has freed himself. The ‘self’ to which those bills are addressed isn’t really him. The real Richard Vobes—the man, the spirit, the soul—is untouched by such petty concerns. 

The system may still want its money, but Richard? He has already ascended.
