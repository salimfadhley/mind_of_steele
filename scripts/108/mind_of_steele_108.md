Link 1: What lengths will Richard Vobes go to in order to avoid paying his gas bill?

There are a few sights in life that strike instant fear: The flash of a speed camera, an email titled “Quick catch-up?” from your manager, or the sight of a white window-envelope on the doormat.

A utility bill.

We could have burned less gas, worn an extra jumper, or just embraced a colder, more character-building existence. But we didn’t. We chose warmth—and now, inevitably, the bill has arrived.

Most of us accept this transaction. We used the energy, so now we must pay for it. Could it be any other way?

Fiction is full of characters who say yes.
•	Tyler Durden rejects consumerism, abandons his legal identity, and builds an underground fight cult.
•	Reginald Perrin fakes his own death to escape suburban drudgery.
•	The Buddha, never one for half-measures, renounces everything and pursues enlightenment.

And then there’s Richard Vobes.

No disguises. No staged disappearances. No meditative retreat into the forest.
His grand rejection of financial responsibility?

He canceled his direct debit to Southern Water.

> Clip 1 (Richard Vobes): So I thought right I shut off the direct debit, wrote to the bank, said to the bank no thank you turn that direct debit off. Well within three days I got a bit of paper from my water company going well I notice you've turned off your direct debit you owe us now the whole year in one lump. And I thought right. OK. Do you know what I'll pay it but I'll pay it with my Cestui Que Vie trust.

Link 2: The sovereign citizen movement calls itself a fight for freedom, autonomy, and reclamation of rights. 

In reality, it is just an elaborate disguise—an excuse to escape responsibility while still demanding the benefits of a functioning society. 

If you don't want to pay you utility bill, your tax or your loan this movement provides just the excuse you need. It says you can take what you want but you never have to give back. 

In The Fall And Rise of Reginald Perrin, the title character fakes his own death in order to escape the dull responsibilities of his life as a father and salaryman. 

He grows a beard, and adopts a new accent. He introduces himself as Martin Wellbourne, Reggie's long-lost friend from Brazil — but we know they are the same. The disguise is flimsy and superficial, and ultimately everybody sees through it.  

“Much like Reggie, sovereign citizens aren’t really interested in deep philosophical reinvention—they just don’t want to deal with the consequences of their own lives. 

Perrin was not escaping society, he was escaping his job, his mortgage, and his wife’s casserole. Sovereign citizens are doing the same, but without Perrin's wit and humor. 

When Richard talks about ‘freedom,’ and 'responsibility' but what he really mean is ‘freedom from paying bills' and other people's responsibility to keep serving him.

> Clip 2 (Richard Vobes): How is that possible you might say. Well it is possible because you can do this. You can do this. So I got the billy doo that came in because it was a bill. A bill. And I said I'll accept this bill this offer as money as pound sterling. And now you take it back and settle the account. And I signed it in a specific way.

This is like Quake's no-clip mode: A financial cheat-code that instead of allowing Richard to phase through walls, can compel somebody else to pay for literally everything.

Even Vobes— an ardent believer in nonsense—hesitated for a moment. 

Could it really be this easy? Had he, alone, outwitted the entire financial system with nothing but a biro and a signature? 

His life as a mostly out-of-work actor had taught him that money was scarce, and the people did everything they could do to keep it for themselves. 

But this—this could change everything. No more bills. No more financial burdens. If this worked, then society itself had been a needlessly complicated scam all along.

And, he reasoned, if the water company had stopped chasing him for money then maybe he was onto something?

He’s not just some deadbeat who forgot to pay his water bill; He’s an enlightened individual who has cracked the hidden rules of commerce. 

He's the new Black and Scholes. He's the man who discovered the infinite free money supply.

But the only way to know is to push further. If this trick works on a water bill, why not apply it to electricity, council tax, and anybody who demanded money from him?

He's not doing it for himself - he's doing thnis for science.

> Clip 3 (Richard Vobes): And I thought well I'm bloat it bloody well worked and I will do the same on this. And I should probably do the same with my electricity and all other bills and to be honest with you I am experimenting with a number of other bills and I'm waiting to see if they work and I won't say anything if they until they do until they work and I can categorically say to you this works now your water company may be different to my water company may not accept it.

Link 4: Richard has now fully committed to his discovery. What started as a reckless experiment—scribbling some words on a bill and hoping for the best—has, in his mind, transformed into a proven financial hack. 

Initial results are positive; but is this the start of a pattern or an anomaly? But how to test an idea this radical? And if it worked once, then surely it might work elsewhere?

Electricity? Council tax? Why stop there? The banks, the government, the entire global financial system—maybe all of it can be exploited.

If his method works, there must be a hidden mechanism making it work. And that’s when he spots it: the code. Every bill has one. A unique number, or a barcode. Could it be the backdoor into a secret government trust account. 

> Clip 4 (Richard Vobes): So what did I do. Here is an example. Let's have a look. The bill comes in. Now if the bill has as you can see down the bottom here a barcode and often it'll come in as a gyro as it did with mine and it has a barcode. That is the number that accesses the Sester Cave Trust you see.

Link 5: Richard isn’t just testing a theory anymore—he’s following a belief system. This isn’t about dodging a bill; it’s about affirming a new reality, one where financial obligations are a mere illusion, dissolved with the right combination of words and symbols. The barcode isn’t just a random number—it’s a hidden invitation, a key to a secret financial world that ordinary people never question. The more he commits, the more this isn’t just a loophole—it’s proof that everything he thought he knew about money was a lie. And what kind of man, having glimpsed the truth, would just go back to paying his bills like a fool?

And so, Richard presses forward, not just as a man trying to settle an account, but as a pioneer, an explorer of financial territories beyond the grasp of common mortals. He's no longer just testing an idea—he’s demonstrating knowledge, showing that he knows how the system really works. Every letter he writes, every phrase he carefully places, isn't just an action—it’s a statement of defiance. If the banks have rules, then he has counter-rules, and they must obey.

> Clip 5 (Richard Vobes): So I'm told and what you do is you write on it in blue here as you can see. So in other words it says this bill offer is accepted as money for the in this case dollar amount. I put pound sterling shown here and an arrow goes to the amount that they're asking for in this case it's some five thousand is it what is it eight hundred and sixty four pounds.

Link 6: At this point, Richard isn’t just paying his bills—he’s performing a ritual. The wording, the placement, even the color of the ink—it all matters. In his mind, this isn’t just a transaction; it’s a ceremonial unlocking of hidden financial forces, a declaration that he understands the game the banks are playing. Blue ink, specifically, is what gives his words power. Why blue? Well, that’s the kind of detail you’re not supposed to question. Like all good pseudolegal theories, the reasoning is both incredibly specific and completely arbitrary at the same time.

And of course, it’s not enough to simply write the magic words—he must sign honorably. Because, naturally, if you don’t declare yourself the “equitable beneficial named estate trust title holder,” the spell won’t work. This isn’t just paperwork; it’s an affirmation of status, a way of placing himself above the system that demands payment. Richard is no longer just avoiding a bill—he’s asserting his rightful authority over the bureaucratic machine. And like all great sovereign citizen theorists before him, he assumes that as long as he says the words with conviction, the universe will have no choice but to obey.

> Clip 6 (Richard Vobes): Then you sign yours honorably because you want to be honorable the equitable beneficial named estate trust title holder and you sign.

Link 7: Richard has done everything right—or so he believes. He’s followed the process, written the magic words, signed his name honorably, and asserted his rightful authority. He isn’t just submitting a payment; he’s proving that he understands the system’s secret rules, and by following them, he expects the universe to comply. But then, something completely unexpected happens: it doesn’t work. The company simply says no. No hidden trust fund, no erased debts, just a routine rejection of a ridiculous non-payment attempt. For a man who has convinced himself that he holds forbidden financial knowledge, this response isn’t just frustrating—it’s incomprehensible.

But in the sovereign citizen world, failure isn’t evidence that you were wrong—it’s proof that the system is corrupt. Richard isn’t deterred. Instead, he doubles down, convinced that he just needs to push the right bureaucratic buttons to make the scam work. And so, rather than admit defeat, he tries a different approach. If the company won’t accept his method, then they must return the “financial instrument” he originally sent them. It’s a meaningless demand, but it follows the same quasi-legal script that sovereign citizens cling to—if the system won’t bend to your nonsense, just generate more nonsense until they give up.

> Clip 7 (Richard Vobes): so when I did the next one they said no no we don't accept this this isn't payment go away you silly man and and I said well I will go away and I'll pay it another way if you send me back the original financial instrument

Link 8: Richard’s belief in his new financial reality isn’t shaken by failure—if anything, it’s strengthened. When his first attempt seemed to work, that was proof the system could be beaten. But when the same method suddenly stops working, that isn’t proof that he was wrong—it’s proof that the system is rigged. The water company’s refusal to acknowledge his “payment” isn’t just an obstacle; it’s an admission of guilt. And their refusal to return the very document he scrawled on in blue ink? That’s even more suspicious. To Richard, this isn’t just a bill—it’s a transfigured financial instrument, something imbued with real value. By holding onto it, the company is confirming what he already suspects: they know he’s right, and they’re hiding the truth.

And so, rather than rethinking his approach, Richard doubles down. If the system is going to behave like a lawless entity, then why should he respect its authority at all? What started as an attempt to avoid a water bill now becomes a moral crusade against government corruption. If his payment was “good enough” for one institution but not another, that inconsistency is proof that the entire structure of finance is a deliberate fraud. And if the government is committing fraud, then it has no legitimate claim over his money. With that certainty, Richard escalates—from utility companies to council tax, HMRC, and beyond. The stakes are higher, but in his mind, so is the justification. He isn’t just trying to settle his accounts anymore—he’s exposing a conspiracy.

> Clip 8 (Richard Vobes): and that's why I kept saying I'm happy to pay and I did this with the council tax and HMRC and I did exactly the same they're doing the same and I'm just saying look I'm not saying I'm not paying just give me the financial instrument!

Link 9: And so, his search for validation leads him to a new financial theory, one that takes his beliefs to the next level. If institutions refuse to recognize his bills as payment, then why not create his own financial instruments? If money is just a construct, why shouldn’t he construct some himself?

> Clip 9 (Richard Vobes): Hello and welcome to this rather special and somewhat urgent video that I just want to put out there. The other day we had a gentleman on produced a video with me about promissory notes and he said that we can write our own and he gave an example of his.

Link 9: And this is where sovereign citizen logic starts to collapse under its own weight. It’s all fun and games when you’re dodging bills and making grand claims about secret trusts, but the moment real consequences enter the picture, everything changes. Now Richard isn’t boldly declaring financial truths—he’s telling people to do their own research. The certainty is gone, replaced by careful disclaimers.

> Clip 10 (Richard Vobes): And because I think people have got to do their own due diligence and not immediately jump on what any of the guests on this show or any other show say.

Link 10: Richard’s sudden caution isn’t just a passing moment—it’s a turning point. He started this journey as a self-assured guide, revealing hidden financial truths to his audience. But now, uncertainty has crept in. The language of bold declarations is gone, replaced by hesitation and vague warnings. He isn’t telling people to fight the system anymore—he’s telling them to be careful. Maybe he realized he was playing with fire. Maybe he heard about someone getting into serious trouble. Or maybe, just maybe, he’s starting to understand that he could be held responsible.

And yet, rather than admitting outright that his earlier claims were nonsense, Richard takes the classic conspiracy theorist exit strategy—he urges his audience to think for themselves. If the method works, that’s on them. If it doesn’t? Also on them. It’s the sovereign citizen equivalent of a disclaimer at the bottom of a dodgy investment website—he’s still encouraging people to believe, just with enough distance to avoid taking the blame. The confidence is fading, but the illusion isn’t gone just yet.

> Clip 11 (Richard Vobes): Thank you so much. I just wanted to put this out in case you have written any of these and before you manage to send them anywhere
just to take caution and I appreciate you watching and taking on board these points.

Link 12: Richard has gone from bold financial revolutionary to someone who suddenly wants a bit of plausible deniability. His confidence has cracked, but he isn’t walking away just yet. Instead, he’s treading carefully, distancing himself from the methods he once championed while still keeping his audience engaged. He wants to keep his reputation as someone who knows the secrets, but he also wants to make sure that if things go wrong, he’s not the one holding the bag.

And yet, despite his caution, Richard’s next move is even more brazen. If rewriting bills in blue ink didn’t work, if promissory notes didn’t work, then why not take things a step further? His latest method doesn’t just reject the government’s financial system—it rejects his very existence within it. If they keep demanding money from him, well… he’ll just stop being him.

> Clip 12 (Richard Vobes):But anyway, they were hounding me with their letters to pay up, pay up, pay up. So I was advised by somebody. He said, "Try this. Just write on it. The person you're writing to is deceased." Which is a true statement, of course,

Link 13: Is this the Reginald Perrin phase of his escape plan?

Reginald Perrin walked into the sea, shedding his old identity to be reborn as someone new. But Richard Vobes? He doesn’t need such theatrics. No vanishing act, no disguise—just a letter, calmly stating that the person the government is demanding money from no longer exists. No struggle, no resistance, just a simple withdrawal from reality, as effortless as stepping out of a room.

And perhaps, in his mind, this is the final realization: the game was always an illusion. The debts, the demands, the legal threats—mere artifacts of a system designed to entrap the unwary. The suffering it creates? Entirely optional. There is no need to fight if you simply accept that none of it was real to begin with. And so, Richard doesn’t just dodge the rules—he denies their very existence.

> Clip 13 (Richard Vobes): Which is a true statement, of course, because they're writing to a dead entity, aren't they? They're writing to the name, the corporate name.

Link 14: Richard has spent this entire journey seeking financial truth—not dodging debts, but following the deeper rules that ordinary people fail to see. He is not just a man, but the equitable beneficial named estate trust title holder, a being unburdened by the illusions of commerce. His past attempts to engage with the system—through blue ink, barcodes, and the sacred phrasing of promissory notes—were but the fumbling efforts of an unenlightened mind, still tethered to material concerns.

But now, Richard sees clearly. The self that the system is chasing—that corporate entity, that legal fiction—was never real to begin with. So why engage? Why resist? The truest act of sovereignty is not to fight the illusion, but to let it pass through you like mist on a mountaintop. And so, with a stroke of his pen, he renounces not just his financial obligations, but his very existence. If he is not there, then who is left to pay?

> Clip 14 (Richard Vobes): I get this letter then from an estate bailiff. "We're so sorry to hear about the passing of Mr. Vobes. We're so sorry to contact you at this terrible time." But there's 50 quid you owe us.

Link 15: After all the legal gymnastics, the blue ink declarations, and the sovereign citizen word games, Richard has finally stumbled upon a foolproof way to make the debt disappear: just pay it. If he settles the bill, then it no longer matters that he pretended to be dead. The paperwork, the deception, the sovereign citizen logic—none of it will matter anymore, because there will be no debt left to argue over.

And for a brief moment, it seems like he might actually do it. Not because he’s abandoning his beliefs, but because, in a strange way, this too is a loophole. If he clears the debt, he never has to deal with these letters again—no more estate executors, no more urgent demands. It’s the one solution that actually works.

> Clip 15 (Richard Vobes): But it's to the executor of the late Mr. Richard Vobes. One could claim to be the executor if one wanted to pay off the bills.

Link 16: For a fleeting moment, Richard considered the most effective and boring solution—paying the bill. But that would mean acknowledging defeat, and that’s not how a sovereign citizen thinks. Instead, he finds a new angle: since he isn’t actually dead, and he isn’t actually the executor of his own estate, he can simply ignore any mail addressed to one. If the system is going to insist that Richard Vobes has passed away, then fine—let them chase the ghost for their money.

And here’s the best part: he thinks it worked. Unlike his last two failed schemes, this time there’s no rejection letter, no water company refusing his scribbled-on invoice. The bills are still arriving, but they aren’t addressed to him anymore—so as far as Richard is concerned, they don’t exist. He isn’t just dodging debt; he’s outsmarting the entire system. And the only reason he’s telling us all this? Because he’s proud of it.

> Clip 16 (Richard Vobes): Or one can say, "Well, it isn't me." Which it isn't really. It isn't me. And simply say, "No, that's not me." I don't know who that is, so I'm not answering it. Which is my stance. Because if it's not actually me, which it isn't, who knows what will happen next?

Link 18: So, whose opt-out did Richard Vobes’ strategy most resemble?

Did he embrace anger, anarchy, and man-on-man wrestling like Tyler Durden?
Did he stage a dramatic disappearance, leaving behind only a pile of clothes and a mystery, like Reginald Perrin?
Or did he transcend the demands of the material world, rejecting earthly obligations in pursuit of a higher truth, like the Buddha?

Perhaps it is the latter—because, despite everything, the bills still keep coming. The debts remain, the letters pile up, and Richard may well have committed a false representation intended to obtain a financial benefit, contrary to the Fraud Act 2006. But none of that matters to him anymore. He has freed himself. The ‘self’ to which those bills are addressed isn’t really him. The real Richard Vobes—the man, the spirit, the soul—is untouched by such petty concerns. The system may still want its money, but Richard? He has ascended.
