I'm Raynard Wilson, host of award-winning comedy adjacent youtube channel, Mind of Stgeele. Today's special episode is an appeal on behalf of the Matt Houston legal defence fund. You may know him as The Hillingdon Vandal, the man who chops down traffic lights and cameras in West London, but to his friends he's so much more. He's a man of sober advice:

>  Right folks definitely don't go to amazon get one of these 14 pound little uh nail guns just Mr. Carn look just trying on my new little hat what do you reckon? Yeah, grump! Honk if you hate 'em

Why is this noble light warrior being unjustly persecuted? Some say it's because he's repeatedly vandalised London's traffic safety infrastructure. But could it be that he knows too much:

> But you've got a legal defence here. Why is an AMPR camera? It's got this many capacitors in it. This many capacitors in an AMPR camera, folks. So they've got capacitors in there and they can save up energy. And if they fucking put that energy out in a fucking directed beam, an invisible beam,

Matt Houston, single handedly saving the people of Hillingdon in West London from the threat of a deadly laser weapon; Some call him a fantasist. Some Say that he's lazily recycling Mark Steele's ludicrous conspiracy theores so that he can monetise attention on his TikTok shop - but we know he has the proof:

 > Man can prove that it's fucking 5G in this street. All charges fucking dropped. And he's getting his gun back. But then even better than this, it's a fucking skill saw. You get 185 mil skill saw, try and catch it but look again couldn't and that'd do it in three seconds. Timber!

If you want Matt Houston to have his gun back; that's where you can be part of this appeal; If you are impressed with what Matt Houston can do with a reciprocating saw and hardened blade, just imagine how powereful he would be fully armed? 

> I wewnt out with MAP gas torch on a pole. I always use MAP gas because it burns hotter than butane. It just aniahlites it. Freedom isn't free, folks. You've got to fucking fight for it here. They gave me two charges of criminal damage for fucking painting. And they said, "oh, going equipped'. You've got a flag pole and a butane torch.

Freedom isn't free - and if you value freedom then please like and comment on this video. Please refer your friends and send a signal to the police force and court system that is prosecuting mat for vandalism, theft and racially abusing employees of Transport for London. This injustice must stop. This censorshop must stop:

> That's what happened on my accounts. My Facebook and that were all growing massively  until I started fucking getting popular.****And they were like, "Fuck, this boy's too popular here. We need to fucking do something about this.

The Pharisses hated him because he told the truth. They tried to cut him down because he flew too close to the sun. They had to lock him up they weren't ready for his revelations, and the fact that he keeps sawing down traffic lights.

> "I can prove that the fucking ULEZ is a laser fucking gun, a weapon system. And you legally defend yourself
from that. That's what we're saying. You say it to me, cut it down, so I cut it down if I fucking want, because it can hurt me. I can legally defend myself from that. Throw it out, they don't want me in court

And that's why we need to support Matt Houston's legal case; we want him to present this well-thought-out legal argument in a british crown court, one that has the power to sentence Matt Houston to years of impisonment for the crime he's managed to convince himself he didn't do. We know what happens when people repeat Mark Steele's conspiracy theories in court - it always goes the same way:

> throw out. They don't want me in court saying what I'm saying, but they'll try and keep the charges against me to the very last minute just to keep me disrupted up until then. They're not going to drop it now. Even though they know that we know That's why I've been I cut my fucking tag off once. And fucking they didn't come here for two weeks. The pricks.

Thye might drop it, but that's why Matt Houston needs your thoughts and prayers. For every thought and prayer you send Matt, I'm, going to double it. Just imagine all of us imagining together. But please, also give the video a non-imaginary thumbs up; because it's the best way we can suppoprt this brave truth-warrior.

 > We can prove you this is a weapon system, so please do take us to court. Let us get in there and prove it. I cut my fucking tag off my leg. I'm walking free. Why is that? Why don't they come and fucking reminded me? I'll tell you for why. Cause if they remind me, I get to present evidence before a judge in chambers. We get to show them what the ULAZ is. eah, a weapon system.

Free Matt Houston. As Free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows - born free, to follow your heart. 

> Non player characters fucking everywhere.  It's a Jew laser weapon. I'll tell you what to do. Get a frequency generator on your phone, right? And if something, you can see fucking buildings catching on fire all round. You put 666 frequency on it and it'll stop it. It's the frequency for the color blue.

London needs you. The world needs you. We need your casual antisemitism, and your attention seeking vandalism thinly disgused as an act of self defence. Please, if you want to live in a world where religious minorities don't shoot space-lasers at innocent people like Matt, give this video your approval. Send a message to Matt to say we've got his back.

> It's laser weaponry, it's a laser geezer. They're not cameras, they're laser weapons, stop calling them cameras. Here we are with folks back in the day time to have a look at it.
