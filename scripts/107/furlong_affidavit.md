Erin go bragh

   	Affidavit of Truth

I: Michael-Henry: Furlong, a man, am over the age of consent, am a creation of God-Almighty and a follower of God’s laws first and foremost, and the laws of man when they are not in conflict (Leviticus 18:3-4). Pursuant to Matthew 5:33-37 and James 5:12, let my yea be yea, and my nay be nay, as supported by Law.
I have personal knowledge of the matters stated herein and hereby asseverate, understanding both the spiritual and legal liabilities of, “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exodus chapter 20, Deuteronomy Chapter 5).
1)	I am the Affiant, a man, and one of the People of England, being a creation of God and domiciled in one of several County’s; and

2)	I am, a living, breathing, sentient being on the land, a Natural creation of God and therefore am not and cannot be any ARTIFICIAL PERSON and, therefore am exempt from any, and all identifications, treatments, and requirements, as such pursuant to any process, law, code, act or statute, or any colour thereof; see: Guaranty Trust Co. v. Henwood, 307 U.S. 247 (1939), Perry v. United States, 294 U.S. 330 (1935), Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419 (1793), Penhallow v. Doanes (1795); and

3)	In England, the authority of any, and all government is a fiction of the mind and can only be created by the People, affected by the People, overseen by the People, for the benefit of the People, and to secure the individual God-given rights of the people; see: Penhallow v. Doanes (1795); and

4)	I reserve, claim all, and waive none of my God-given, secured, and guaranteed Rights; and

5)	As a matter of their lawful compliance to the Common Law, any of the People, while functioning in any public capacity, in return for the trust of the People, are granted limited delegated authority by the People, with specific duties delineated in accordance thereof, shall only do so pursuant to a lawfully designated, and sworn and subscribed Oath of Office and any and all bonds required thereof; see: Canon 3008; and


6)	The only court authorised by the Common law to hear matters of the People is a court that conforms and functions in accordance with the Common Law in which all Officers of the court abide by their sworn and subscribed Oaths of Office and support and defend the rights of the People and are heard only in “Trial by Jury”, in accordance with all aspects of due process of Law (refer to R v. Penn and Mead or Trial of Penn and Mead, 6 How. 951 and the Bushel’s Case (1670) 124 E.R. 1006) (exhibition R), Canon 3008; and

7)	Pursuant to the supreme Law of the Land and God-given Rights secured and guaranteed therein, the Natural Law is established to ensure the dominion granted by God to all People, on this land, shall endure and ensure forever that the People on this land be free from any, and all slavery, indenturement, tyranny, and oppression under the colour of any Law, statute, code, act, policy, procedure, or of any other type; see: Deuteronomy 24:7; and

8)	Pursuant to the Common Law, I cannot be compelled, manipulated, extorted, tricked, threatened, placed under duress, or coerced or so affected, under the colour of law by any Natural Person, who individually, or any capacity as, or under, any Artificial Person, agency, entity, officer, or party, into waiving any of my Rights or to act in contradiction thereof, or to act in opposite of the moral conscience and dominion granted to me by God, nor can I be deprived of any of these Rights, privileges, and immunities except by lawful process in accordance with the Law, without that Natural and/or Artificial Person, in whatever capacity;  Anyone using any process, not in accordance with the Common Law, causing injury to me, thereby commits numerous crimes, requiring lawful punishment therefrom; see: Canon 2965, B.O.R 1988/89, B.O.E ####; Article 30.2; and

9)	I am not a citizen, resident, subject, taxpayer, et al., of the municipal corporations and private corporations, which are Fictions of Law that cannot make claims against a man and his Private Property; see: Penhallow v. Doanes (1795); and

10)	 Job 32:21-22, let me not I pray thee, accept another man’s person.
        Nobody may contract in the name of another.
        If the thing itself does not know its name, surely it is lost. (exhibition X); and

11)	 Administrative Courts are unlawful – Halsbury’s Law: The law is absolutely clear on this subject. There is NO authority for administrative courts in this country and no Act can be passed to legitimise them because of the constitutional restraints placed upon her Majesty at Her coronation (exhibition Z); see: Canon 2965, B.O.R 1688/9 (exhibition ##); and

12)	I: Michael-Henry, am the Creditor and beneficiary having invoked article IV of the Cestui Que Vie Act 1666, as one being found to be alive and claim my estate as expressed in the Ecclesiastical asseveration and proof of life (see other relevant documents) and Affidavit of Status (exhibition X), Canon 1298, 1300, 2035, 2036, 2055, 2056, 2057, Deuteronomy 24:7; and

13)	The case of: John Colthorpe vs. THE MASONIC TRUST on the 2nd February Nineteen-Hundred-and-ninety-five at the Royal Courts of Justice is the divine case law that proves Non-disclosure of the MASONIC TRUST breached Article 29 of the Magna Carta (1215): The body of a free man is not to be arrested, or imprisoned, or disseised, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way ruined, nor is the king to go against him or send forcibly against him, except by judgment of his peers or by the law of the land (exhibition K), Canon 1298, 1300, 2035, 2036, 2055, 2056, 2057, Deuteronomy 24:7,  and

14)	Further case law is emphasised by the Trial of William Penn 1670 (exhibition R); and


15)	There are (10) essential maxims or precepts in commercial law. Those being: -


i)	“Workman is worthy of his hire”. The first of these is expressed in Exodus 20:15; Lev. 19:13; Mat. 10:10; Luke 10:7; II Tim. 2:6.
Legal maxim: “It is against equity for freemen not to have the free disposal of their own property”; and


ii)	“Equality before the law” or more precisely, All are equal under the law. (Gods Law – Moral and Natural Law). Exodus 21:23-25; Lev. 24:17-21; Deut. 1:17, 19:21; and


iii)	“In Commerce Truth is Sovereign”. (Exodus 20:16; Ps. 117:2; John 8:32; II Cor. 13:8). Truth is sovereign – and the Sovereign tells only the truth; and


iv)	“Truth is expressed in the form of an Affidavit” (Lev. 5:4-5; Lev. 6:3-5; Lev. 19:11-13; Num. 30:2; Mat. 5:33; James 5:12). An affidavit is the solemn expression of truth. In commerce, an affidavit must be accompanied and must underlay and form the foundation for any commercial transaction whatsoever; see: This Affidavit; and


v)	“An unrebutted Affidavit stands as truth in commerce”. (12 Pet. 1:25; Heb. 6:13-15) Claims made in an affidavit, if not rebutted, emerge as the truth of the matter. Legal Maxim: “He who doesn’t deny, admits”; See Case File Affidavits for case: 2402150/2020; and


vi)	“An unrebutted Affidavit becomes the judgment in Commerce”. (Heb. 6:16-17). There is nothing left to resolve. Any proceeding in any court, tribunal, or arbitration forum consists of some contest, or duel, of commercial affidavits wherein the points remaining unrebutted in the end stand as truth and matters to which the judgment of the law is applied; and


vii)	“In Commerce for any matter to be resolved it must be expressed”. (Heb. 4:16; Phil. 4:6; Eph. 6:19:21). No one is the mind reader, and the issue must be stated to be resolved. Legal Maxim: “He who fails to assert his rights has none”; and


viii)	“He who leaves the battlefield first loses by default”.  (Book of Job; Mat. 10:22). This means that an affidavit which is unrebutted point for point stands as “Truth in commerce” because it hasn’t been rebutted and has left the battlefield; and


ix)	“Sacrifice is the measure of credibility”. (No willingness to sacrifice = no liability, responsibility, authority, or measure of conviction). Legal Maxim: “He who bears the burden ought also to derive the benefit”; and


x)	“The lien or claim can be satisfied only by way of rebuttal by Affidavit point by point, Resolution by Jury, or Payment”. (Gen. 2-3; Mat. 4; Revelation.); and


16)	In May 2023 I: Michael-Henry, was stopped whilst riding my bicycle to collect my daughter from school by a young man who attempted to contract with, I: Michael-Henry, by way of an alleged infringement of a corporate statute/act, that did not apply to me, and without my consent. No consent was given by I: Michael-Henry, having resigned from holding office of Crown Copyright entity MR MICHAEL FURLONG in September Two-thousand-and-twenty-two (exhibition Y – resignation letters), Matthew 22:15–21, Romans 2:6-16, Revelation 18:4, Rice v. Connelly (1966); and

17)	 This action was taken after my researched discovery of the suppressed document FEDERAL COMMISSION ORDER: 30/1048 disclosing the Treason committed by Sir Edward Heath upon surrendering England’s sovereignty by joining the European Economic Community on 1st January 1973 (See Other Relevant Documents); and

18)	The Monarch was deposed and given a change of title, therefore any act of parliament, statute and law implemented post 1st January 1973 is treason; See: Clearfield Doctrine, Treason Act ####; and

19)	On 15th August 1971 Richard Nixon took the USD off the gold standard, the USD is printed by the FEDERAL RESERVE which is a non-governmental independent US corporation with shareholders, this means anybody who is paid in GBP cannot uphold their Judicial Oath because they are paid and economically motivated by a foreign US Independent corporation that is the FEDERAL RESERVE; See: Coronation Oath Act 1688, B.O.R 1688/9, Act of Settlement 1700, Treason Act ####,Clearfield Doctrine and

20)	Should the court derive its authority from the Magistrates courts act 1980 the court would be in Treason and therefore void of any and all alleged Jurisdiction over the English national sovereign; See: Treason act ####, Clearfield Doctrine, Perfidy canons, Luke 11:52; and

21)	“A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within.  An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself” – Cicero; and


22)	I: Michael-Henry, politely declined the man, I now know to be called Matthew’s less than attractive contract offer of a cycling citation , the refusal to contract made Matthew somewhat irate and he said this was now grounds to search I: Michael-Henry; a police constable is not to involve himself in civil matters, therefore Matthew was acting Ultra vires; see: Nolan Principles, Canon 1752, 1753, 1754, 1755; Matthew 6:24 (the irony); and


23)	I: Michael-Henry informed Matthew, that the manner of the search was unlawful as with no victim there can be no injured party, Bill of Rights 1688/9. (exhibition M); Article 29, Magna Carta 1215 (exhibition N); Canon 2035, 2965, 3005, 3006, 3007, 3008, 3113, 3184, 3188; and


24)	He found a small quantity of vegetable matter during the unlawful search, See: Genesis 1:30; and


25)	I: Michael-Henry was then unlawfully arrested and kidnapped for the alleged charge of the Misuse of drugs ACT and unable to collect my daughter from school and detained for several hours; See; Magna Carta Article 29, Peonage, Palermo Protocols,  Canon 3113; and

26)	I: Michael-Henry informed the desk sergeant at BELLE VALE POLICE STATION of my daughter being stranded at school so could I telephone my mother to collect her; and

27)	I: Michael-Henry’s bicycle was taken to EDGE LANE POLICE STATION; and

28)	My mother collected my daughter late from school due to my unlawful search and kidnapping, for which I was told there was a charge levied; see Canon 3113, 3184, 3188; Magna Carta Article 29, B.O.R 1688/9; and


29)	I: Michael-Henry did not divulge any details to any agent of Merseyside police and was forced to give fingerprints under duress, I informed the agents biometrics were subject to fee schedule and signed ‘vi coactus’ on the correspondence; see Canon 2248, 2249, 2250, 2251, 2252, 2348, 3196;  and


30)	I: Michael-Henry, never claimed to be from the UNITED KINGDOM nor would I claim to be from any corporation as doing so would mean I would be a by-product of a fiction, which would be absurd to deny one’s own existence, and also render me in treason as a secondary offender.
       Job. 32:21-22;
       21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
       22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away; see Uttering, peonage, Fraud Act 2006, Defamation, Slander, Palermo Protocols, Criminal conversion, Deuteronomy 24:7; and


31)	I: Michael-Henry, instructed the MICHAEL FURLONG ATTORNEY IN FACT
       GRANTOR TRUST to contact the court and settle all outstanding business for MR MICHAEL FURLONG; (exhibition G) and;


32)	I: Michael-Henry, attended Liverpool Queen Elizabeth Court at room 2.2 on 26th June Two-thousand-and-twenty-three, with an independent witness who held in his possession the fullest representation of the PERSON; MR MICHAEL FURLONG the birth certificate bond which was conveyed into private trust, namely the MICHAEL FURLONG ATTORNEY IN FACT GRANTOR TRUST on the Fifteenth of June two-thousand and twenty-three, the clerk and all three magistrates handled MR FURLONG and were informed I: Michael-Henry, was not authorised to contract for it (exhibition F - Dean Robinson Affidavit), Power of Attorney, Canon 2057, ; and


33)	I: Michael-Henry, was informed a warrant for MR FURLONG would be issued for non-appearance in court which I found somewhat strange having witnessed the multiple crown agents handling it, along with an independent witness who was holding it (exhibition F), Canon 1298, 1300, 1748, 1749, 1750, 1751, 2035, 2038, 2055, 2056, 2057, 2158, 2159, 2259, 2362, 2364, 2268, 2369, 2370, 2371, 2372, 2373, 2374, 2375, 2831, 3181, C/F: Fraud Act (2006), Peonage, Barratry, Perfidy, Treason; and


34)	I: Michael-Henry, was informed by a trustee that they had been notified of the issuance for an alleged warrant for MR FURLONG on an internal business form 169.C. by a PC1981 of MERSEYSIDE POLICE, see: B.O.E #### Article 30.2, Uttering, Canon 3181; and


35)	I: Michael-Henry, instructed the MICHAEL FURLONG ATTORNEY IN FACT GRANTOR TRUST of this occurrence and instructed them to ensure that I: Michael-Henry was not mistaken for MR FURLONG; and


36)	The Trust sent a Memorandum of Trust to both the Court Clerk (NY 4885 7726 4GB) and BELLE VALE POLICE STATION (NY 4885 7727 8GB) (exhibition H) on 30th June two-thousand and twenty-three, informing the incumbents of the error as MR FURLONG was indeed presented to the clerk and three magistrates (see; supporting Affidavit, (Exhibition F - Dean Robinson Affidavit), Canon 2831; and


37)	On the 11th of July two-thousand-and-twenty-three, I was awoken by my father and AGENT 5891 claiming to have a warrant for MR FURLONG, I: Michael-Henry, started to record this encounter on a mobile phone (exhibition B), Uttering, Davis vs. Lisle 1936, Canon 2255; and


38)	At the three-minute mark I: Michael-Henry attempted to surrender a certified copy of MR FURLONG to the AGENT 5891 and requested the agents name to ascertain his jurisdiction (exhibition B), Fraud Act 2006, Canon 2057, 3007; and


39)	I: Michael-Henry, Informed AGENT 5891 that MR FURLONG was indeed in the alleged court and I: Michael-Henry, would require his name in his private capacity, as subjecting me to peonage would result in kidnapping and would be subject to fee schedule; see Canon 3184, 3188, 3186; and


40)	AGENT 5891 responded @3min30seconds (see; Video evidence — exhibition B) stating “If you are going to be videoing this, I will be seizing your phone as evidence”, I found this rather peculiar as he had his own body camera that he could have recorded his own evidence on and without an authentic warrant would have constituted aggravated burglary; and


41)	AGENT 5891 proceeded with unwanted contact and was informed that this was assault, and asked if he had a warrant, AGENT 5891 said he did have a warrant, I: Michael-Henry, asked could I see the warrant to ascertain the name of the incumbent who had authorized the warrant and verify its grammatical standing as MR MICHAEL FURLONG was indeed in the alleged court along with I: Michael-Henry; see: C/F: Assault, Fraud Act (2006), Canon 3181, 3184, 3188; and


42)	AGENT 5891 then informed me he had a digital warrant; this was a breach of Criminal Procedure Rule 2020 section13.5.2 (exhibition Q) as there was a clear error, so I: Michael-Henry, required the name of the incumbent to ascertain was it issued in error? or was it malicious?, this investigation would require the name of the author of said warrant and bond; see: Canon 1753, 1754, 1755, 1757, 1758, 1759, 1761, 2827, 2829, 3176, 3181, 3184, Malfeasance in Public Office; and


43)	I: Michael-Henry, again attempted to surrender a certified copy of the best representation of MR MICHAEL FURLONG (the Birth certificate) to agent 5891 who continued to assault and twist I: Michael-Henry by the wrist, then AGENT 5891 asked me to stop filming; see Canon 3181, 3184, 3196; and


44)	Again, I: Michael-Henry asked AGENT 5891 for his name which again he did not provide and continued with the unwanted contact and reluctance to disclose the author of the alleged warrant, I: Michael-Henry had to pass the phone to my father to continue the recording of the occurrence due to AGENT 5891 not taking too kindly to me having a valid visual record of the event and continuing with his assault; and


45)	Agent 5891 would still not divulge his name, I: Michael-Henry informed AGENT 5891 that I did not wish to contract with him, AGENT 5891 continually refused to identify himself in his role as Constable and repeatedly failed to divulge the name of the incumbent who issued the alleged warrant all the while continuing to physically assault I: Michael-Henry; and

46)	I: Michael-Henry informed AGENT 5891 that I would accompany him once it had been ascertained either the name of the incumbent who issued said warrant or the SURNAME of AGENT 5891 to ascertain which Bond was bringing the alleged claim; and


47)	I: Michael-Henry informed AGENT 5891 that he was in beach of his due process by not permitting me to validate his claim of possession of a valid authentic warrant @5:47/15:48 (see: exhibition B - Video) and C/f: Criminal procedure rules 2020 13.5.2 (exhibition Q)


48)	Again AGENT 5891 refused to identify himself in breach of his Oath of office and Criminal procedure rules 2020, 13.5.2 AGENT 5891 was asked to show the warrant to the camera, AGENT 5891 quickly folds the alleged warrant up and put it into his pocket at approximately 7minutes 50 seconds on the recording (exhibition B); and

49)	I: Michael-Henry, instructed my mother several times to go into the living room out of the way of AGENT 5891 who was insistent on subjecting me to peonage and have me stand as surety for the MICHAEL FURLONG ATTORNEY IN FACT GRANTOR TRUST Res; and


50)	Again I: Michael-Henry informed AGENT 5891 if he provided the name of the incumbent that issued the alleged warrant that I would come with him as MR FURLONG was in court, AGENT 5891 manhandled and assaulted my mother and threatened to take her in for obstruction despite him not identifying himself nor disclosing the author of the alleged warrant, not in full uniform, nor providing any supporting affidavit for the false claim of MR MICHAEL FURLONG’S alleged non-appearance in court on the 26th June Two-thousand-and-twenty-three (exhibition F – Dean Robinson Affidavit); and


51)	AGENT 5891 then continued in his peonage of I: Michael-Henry by continually attempting to handcuff me as surety for the trust Res, knocking furniture over and assaulting my mother in the process, AGENT 5891 continued his ‘assault and peonage’ in the garden to the rear of the property where I had no option but to invoke the ‘Castle Doctrine’ in an attempt to defend myself whilst being subjected to a belligerent act of war and domestic terrorism; See: (exhibition P); and


52)	I struck AGENT 5891 with a right-handed punch, AGENT 5891 headbutted me twice and split my eyebrow then he continued his frenzied assault punching me with handcuffs in his fist before he was joined by AGENT 2155 who assisted with the ‘peonage and assault’ where I was handcuffed and dragged through the house outside to await ‘trafficking’ as unauthorized surety for the trust Res in breach of the Palermo Protocols (see exhibit L); and


53)	My mother said she had marks on her arm from AGENT 5891’s assault on her and I: Michael-Henry reassured her the whole episode was on camera; See: Davis vs. Lisle 1936; and

54)	I: Michael-Henry was taken to Copy Lane Police Station, held overnight and taken to Birkenhead Court, I: Michael-Henry informed the man acting as Judge or Magistrate that I was not authorised to contract for MR MICHAEL FURLONG and that my faith was protected under his Obligation to the C/f: International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to hold my faith harmless, Job. 32:21-22, Revelation 18:4 -  And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues; See: Palermo Protocols, Uttering, Peonage, Barratry, Canons 1298, 1300, 2056, 2057, and


55)	I: Michael-Henry, was then trafficked by GeoAmey to Altcourse private prison where I refused to contract due to my fiduciary obligations, I: Michael-Henry was held in involuntary servitude for fifteen (15) days only to be released on or around the 27th July two-thousand-and-twenty-three, without charge, the guard who came to release me informed me when I asked about my day in court that “It is not in the public interest” therefore AGENT 5891 was in breach of all seven principles of public life (exhibition L); and

56)	Whilst held unlawfully in Altcourse Private Prison I was told if I did not provide my biometrics I would not have access to a phone of food, I informed the staff that I was unauthorized to contract for MR FURLONG any longer, having resigned from that office in 2022 (see exhibition Y), and conveying the bond into a foreign private trust, along with Lasting power of attorney; and


57)	On or around the 31st of May Two-thousand-and-twenty-four a trustee informed me that MICHAEL FURLONG had been cited with a NOTICE OF CRIMINAL CHARGE for the alleged offence of assaulting Police Constable 5891 BENEDICT MCCAFFREY; and


58)	Due to power of attorney for MR MICHAEL FURLONG being with the Trust and I: Michael-Henry having no right of representation granted (exhibition G - DS 1025 9147 5GB, 15th June 2023) was instructed the power of attorney would accompany MR MICHAEL FURLONG to the hearing on Friday the 12th July Two-thousand-and-twenty-four, accompanied by two witness’ (exhibition C - Video interview); and


59)	Upon requesting the Oath of office pursuant to the affidavits above, no jurisdiction was established and therefore, no legitimate warrant could have been issued, we feel this is a most important fact as he who makes the claim holds the burden of proof (maxim), yet no warrant has been produced even as I: Michael-Henry write this Affidavit despite Data Subject Access Requests to the court and the Ministry of Justice , the Information Commissioners Office have been informed by email (exhibitions U); and

60)	Data subject access requests could not provide the name of the incumbent who was the author of the alleged warrant. With no valid warrant there is no case. (exhibitions U); and

61)	On the 15th of July-Two-thousand-and-Twenty-twenty-four the power of attorney of MR MICHAEL FURLONG attended St. Anne’s Street Police Station with two (2) independent witnesses who proceeded to document the breaches and fraud whilst lodging a Cease and desist and Data Subject Access Request to ascertain the author of the warrant, one AGENTS name was IAN CARNEY the other failed to identify himself and refused to action the cease and desist order nor produce the warrant in question. See: (exhibition D); and

62)	On the 17th of October I: Michael-Henry was stopped by Police at 1:40am approximately and subjected to an unlawful search, I was cuffed and searched held for 20 minutes approximately asked to identify myself, I offered no joinder and declined any implied contracts and cited Rice vs Connelly (exhibition J) I was released to go about my business after requesting a search record and was given a card with a reference number and two AGENTS numbers namely 6290 and 8132; and

63)	At approximately 4.00am the same evening I was asleep at my mother’s address when I heard a loud banging on the door, I answered the door and was immediately seized and pulled into the garden in nothing but my underwear, the door closing behind me, one of the assailants asked would I like them to retrieve my clothing?, to which I replied “Do you have a warrant?” upon hearing this the AGENT just sniggered; and

64)	Again, I was ‘trafficked’ to Copy Lane police station where I was interrogated (yet refused to contract), I was kept overnight and again trafficked by GeoAmey to Birkenhead court held for a few more hours and brought from the cells to three magistrates; and

65)	I requested the names of the incumbents before we began and was told “No”, I informed the incumbents I was not authorised to contract for the name MICHAEL FURLONG as I did not hold power of attorney I was ignored treated with utter ‘contempt’ and subjected again to ‘peonage’; and

66)	I was issued with two court dates at different courts and bail conditions every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 12-2pm with no contract, warrant, or obligation to perform ever being produced, I sign this each time ‘non usufruct’, ‘vi coactus’ for fear of my mother being terrorised again for a breach of the alleged obligation of bail; and

67)	On the second or third time of attending bail conditions ‘under duress’ and threat of unlawful kidnap and assault again, I told the AGENT behind the desk at St Annes Street Police Station that I required a search record and he said he would need my name, I did not divulge my name at the time and did again inform the AGENT that I did not wish to disclose it, the man came back a few minutes later and said there was no record; and

68)	I requested his name, and he wrote his number on the search card, his number is AGENT 53007; and

69)	The next visit I asked again and was furnished with a six-page document incident number MP-20241017-0056 log number 0056, to my surprise this document contained my details having declined to contract and joinder, citing RICE vs CONNELLY (exhibition J) during and after the unlawful search which is fraud, uttering and peonage (see Other Relevant Documents); and

70)	This scenario is currently up to speed as of the, Tenth of November Two-thousand-and-Twenty-four;

71)	I am not an expert in Law, however I do know right from wrong; If there is any man damaged by any statements herein, if he informs me by facts, I will sincerely make every effort to amend my ways; I hereby and herein reserve the right to amend and make amendments to this document as necessary, in order that the truth may be ascertained, and proceedings justly determined; If the parties given notice by means of this document have information that would controvert and overcome this Affidavit, please advise me IN WRITTEN AFFIDAVIT FORM within Seven (7) days from receipt hereof, proving with particularity by stating all requisite actual evidential fact and all requisite actual law, and not merely the ultimate facts or conclusions of law, that this Affidavit Statement is substantially and materially false sufficiently to change materially my status and factual declarations; and

Canon 1298
Failure to disclose or admit upon request the existence of a cestui que vie trust, instead of a beneficiary relationship to an estate constitutes a fundamental breach of duties of any administrator or executor of the estate, and most serious fraud requiring their immediate removal and serious punishment.

Canon 1300
Under their solemn obligations and duties as trustee, it is the sole responsibility at first opportunity of any administrator or executor not the person before them to offer remedy and relief to re-establish their competency, living status and return thus extinguishing the Cestui Que Vie Trust and returning any remaining assets.


Holy Scripture - Deuteronomy 24:7
“If a man is found stealing any of his brothers of the sons of Israel, and makes merchandise of him, or sells him, then that thief shall die, and you shall put away evil from among you”.
