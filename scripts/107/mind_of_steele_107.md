Mind of Steele 107
===

Link 1:  The Dunning-Kruger effect: It is the universe's most hilarious cognitive bias - the tendency of complete idiots to vastly overestimate their knowledge and intellect. It is why profoundly stupid and ignorant people to often presume that they are the smartest geniuses in the room. 

An understanding of the Dunning Kreuger effect may help us understand certain anomalous behaviours. Why, for example is Phil McLoughlin trying desperately to get into Sefton Magistrate's court, and what does he hope to achieve by harassing the court's security staff? 

> Clip 1: (Phil McLoughlin) That's an organisation, a criminal corporation. So therefore you work for a criminal organisation.

Link 2a: Phil McLoughlin - the living embodiment of the Dunning-Kruger effect. He's a man who believes himself to be one of the few sentient beings in the universe, surrounded by a sea of mindless NPCs.

You can imagine writing characters like Phil and his imbecile friend Harv as comic relief characters. They are like Bulk and Skull, from Power Rangers, or Team Rocket in the Pokemon franchise. 

Team Rocket, whilst technically the antagonists of many episodes - they were the funniest characters because their bumbling failure stood in stark contrast to their opinions of themselves. They were so bad at being bad, their preposterous schemes would always end in hilarious failure. 

Bulk and Skull were the funniest characters in Power Rangers because their inflated sense of self-importance was constantly undermined by their own incompetence. Whether they were trying to unmask the Rangers, act as self-proclaimed heroes, or assert their dominance, their hair-brained schemes always collapsed. 

This trope combines excessive bravado, combined with utter lack of self-awareness; Everybody can see where the story will end except for  made their inevitable failures all the more hilarious.

I think that's what Phil and his buddies do for the Sovereign Citizen movement.  It's almost as if somebody took the foresight of Team Rocket, and merged that with the charisma of Bulk and Skull, and created a mad-cap characture of a human being. 

There are so many classic Phil and Harv moments - who could forget the time when the zany duo managed to “kidnap” themselves in an NCP car park? We all laughed at the idiocy of Phil wandering the streets of Birmingham, telling a police officer that he was a “kidnapping” victim:

-- kidnapping clip

Link 2b: We all laughed until we cried when Phil and his brain-addled friend kept wandering around the streets of Birmingham, claiming to have been kidnapped by the car park. I could wallow in nostalgia for hours, reminiscing at the whacky fun we had watching classic episodes of Phil and Harv. 

But the problem with being a comic relief character is that you cannot keep playing the same jokes. The Lulz have to get wilder and bigger. Fortunately, Phil is ever keen to oblige us.

> Clip 2: (Phil McLoughlin)  Michael was taken to court for riding his push-bike. Now there was no verified criminal complaint. No one's made a complaint against him. It's a corporation, an agent for a corporation, a police constable who's supposed to be a constable, who's an officer, who's standing outside of his over office.

Link 3: Lawyers say that the man who represents himself has a fool for a client; But what can we say about the sovereign citizen who appoints Phil McLoughlin as his legal representative? He makes the regular fool seem like some kind of strategic genius. 

Phil is correct to point out that Michael was cycling when he was arrested; but he omits some crucial and quite significant facts... facts that the police might be aware of:

Firstly, it wasn't so much Michael's mode of transport but what he was transporting - specifically 23 grams of Moroccan black-tar hashish, some of which he had previously consumed - possibly contributing to his somewhat erratic trajectory.

But in these permissive times, even such a large quantity of cannabis might not send a man to Crown Court. I doubt even that his refusal to give his name to the police was much of a factor either; I'm going to take a bet that what really escalated this from a summary offence to an indictable offence was the thing that happened a few days later:

I'm referring to the naked wrestling match that I covered in last week's thrill-packed episode of mind of Steele. An episode so steamy that it should have come with an explicit content warning - along with the usual memetic hazard warning. 

You know, the normal kind of brain damage that you get from watching Sovereign Citizens. 

> Clip 3: (Phil McLoughlin) **** All you are is a corporation listed on Dun & Bradstreet. Now we've got your corporation details, we've got your Dun & Bradstreet numbers, and we know your shareholders. So now you're in a position where you no longer work for the people

Link 4: Phil genuinely believes that he's the only one clever enough to see this vast conspiracy. He's somewhat like that other brave exposer of Fraud, Gary Waterman. At least Gary has the decency to hide himself in a caravan far, far away from civilisation. 

Phil, is compelled to turn up anywhere he perceives injustice…, which unfortunately for the rest of us, is literally everywhere.

> Clip 4: (Phil McLoughlin)  Now there's not one judge in this land, apart from a justice of the peace through the judiciary, that has authority to sign any warrant whatsoever. That's why you never have hands on a proper correct warrant that's got an embossed seal that's been signed by the judge who's ordered it.

Link 5: This is astonishing news to all those district court, circuit court and high court judges who have been issuing warrants for the last few centuries. Their sudden demotion may come as a shock. 

As for Justices of the Peace, currently the lowest rank of the British judicial system - they must be thrilled to learn that this new power has been specially vested in them. 

Phil gives and he takes away. Phil acts like a beneficent deity—dispensing justice on his own terms—while reserving the most formidable powers just for himself.

> Clip 5: (Phil McLoughlin) I've dismissed that case. So if I had authority in that court, and I dismissed the case, because I'm the attorney in fact for that corporation, and that entity on there, that corporate entity on there, is property of this trust.

Link 6: Case dismissed. Without anybody's knowledge - Phil McLoughlin snuck into that courtroom and said the magic words that made the case disappear. Until today, only the King could do that... now it's the King of England, and Philip McLoughlin from Liverpool TPR.

Apparently, if you wave your hand in front of the royal coat of arms and say "I dismiss thee" three times, it vanishes in a puff of logic. It works like an even more toxic version of traditional islamic divorce. 

But why aren't the police officers acknowledging Phil's genius? Why are they still acting like resisting arrest by getting into a naked wresting match with law enforcement is still ilegal? Plil will need to dig deeper into his vast legal knowledge to save his friend:

> Clip 6: (Phil McLoughlin)  And if it's got no signature, and no emboss seal, that's fraud, yeah? And you've got no verified criminal complaint. So this is what we need to know, we need eyes on the warrant today. And I'm attorney in fact, so if that name is on that warrant, I've got, I'm the only one with authority to get eyes on that warrant now.

Link 7: This is an astonishing power-move: Phil McLoughlin, the not-quite attorney at law, is demanding to see the very specific combination of paperwork that... he has just invented. Documents that do not exist, or which have already been produced.

Phil is struggling to understand that in this benighted modern age, electronically produced arrest warrants don't have a "wet ink signature", embossed seal, golden rosette or Elvis Presley's thumb-print. Banaman even featured it in his video.

It's just an email from the court to the relevant police station. And that document, an electronicly transmitted warrant was served a few months ago when Mchael was arrested. 

And the reason that he doesn't know this is he's obviously not a qualified lawyer. Phil is hoping that the police haven't noticed this, or the strong scent of a life smoking Maroccan black-tar hasish. 

He clings to these hope because as a very stupid man he is unable to comprehend the possibility that other people might be experts, or that  they might have a functioning sense of smell.

What is the possibility that at this exact moment, both of the police officers become afflicted by some kind of brain hemorrhage that temporarily reduces their higher cognitive functions to those of a dribbling toddler. As a consequence, they fail to notice that Phil's claims are the unhinged rantings of a lunatic? It's a long-shot, but Phil is an eternal optimist. 

As the old legal aphorism goes: 

If you have the facts, pound the facts.
If you have the law, pound the law.
If you have neither, pound the table.

And if you are unable to pound the table, possibly because you are in some kind of restraining device, like a straight-jacket - you can always try confusing the hell out of everybody.

That seems to be Michael Furlong's strategy.

We join him now, as just as he's emerged from Sefton Magistrate's court... See if you can wring the slightest molecule of sense from this wall of incoherent static? 
  
> Clip 7 - (Michael Henry Furlong):  There's never been an author of the warrants, which... Not me. Yeah, to beat the case law. In R v Clarke and McDaid in 2008, in the UK House of Lords, which is a higher jurisdiction than these courts, eh, they confirmed that there is no valid trial if the bill indictment has not been signed by an appropriate officer in the court, because Parliament has hinted that the indictment be signed by a proper officer in the court. So without that, that result's in a void order,

Link 8: Michael is attempting to cite a bit of case-law called R vs Clarke and McDaid, which if successfully appealed, would have stood for the idea that indictments are invalid if not signed, sealed, stamped, kissed and finally perfumed with eau-de-toilette.

Unfortunately for Michael, the appeal was dismissed, and therefore the case law that Michael thinks exists never became a thing... 

Unless of course they are celebrarting "opposite day" in that suburb of Liverpool.

Michael appears to believe this ruling invalidates all indictments, when in fact it does the exact opposite—it confirms that small procedural omissions don’t derail a prosecution.

And the court didn't actually make an error because digitally issued warrants do not need to be traditionally signed, so this whole argument is completely irrelevant. 

Michael, you just wasted everybody's time. Your time, the judge's time, my time - but worst of all viewers of Mind of Steele. We don't take kindly to your incoherent rambling. This is your last warning - please try to be sane.

But what, you might be wondering, is Michael in trouble for now?

> Clip 8 - (Michael Henry Furlong): Well I was stopped here some time ago for, I went through a red light and I wasn't driving, I was collecting his order, I wasn't in commerce.

Link 9: Running a red light alone wouldn’t usually land you in court, but something tells me there’s more to this story.

> Clip 9 - (Michael Henry Furlong): then he claimed I smelt of alcohol and my eyes were glazed.

Link 10: Have you noticed that the Liverpool TPR crowd seem to be drunk literally all the time. Is their sovereign citizen nonsense caused by decades of alcohol abuse, or is the alcohol abuse a form of self-medication to deal with the stress of being a sovereign citizen?

Has Michael Furlong ever been sober? Does he even know where he is right now? Or is his entire existence just a long, blurry stumble from pub to court and back to then back to the pub for last orders?

> Clip 10 - (Michael Henry Furlong): So he said, "Do you want to take a test?" and I said, "Am I obliged to?" He said, "Yes." I said, "No, no." I was travelling, it comes to be constitutional rights.

Link 11: Michael was not driving, he was merely travelling. This is a clear distinction that seems to matter in the minds of Sovereign Citizens. This is a belief system based on the idea that practicing law is merely a case of knowing the correct magic words to say. 

If you know the incantation, you can force the universe to bend to your will... kind of like Rita Repulsa from Power Rangers. 

But where can you learn this powerful voodoo? It's not taught in any school, nor will you find it in any law library; You might find it within your own soul during a particularly intense ayahuasca binge, perhaps one without the guidance of an experienced shamanic expert to guide you up the holy mountain of your imagination; 

Under such circumstances, one might hallucinate such things, and it is said that these ideas have power. They can carry over to the waking world.

Alternatively, you could just do what Michael Furlong did and learn it from watching conspiracy videos on BitChute and Rumble. 

If you aren't familiar - these are video sharing platforms which mostly host video game reviews made by angry incel men, but also a lot of far-right wing propaganda hosted by angry incel men. 

And in between those two main types of video, youi will find sovereign citizen advice videos. Videos which, you may be surprised to learn, are also made by angry incel men. Men such as Incel Pete:

-- sov pete saying something sexist

So, Michael probably got this idea about asserting his rights under the United States constitution from one of those videos;  But what about his claim to be travelling and not driving?

> Clip 11 - (Michael Henry Furlong): So he was claiming I was driving and I wasn't in commerce, I was collecting my daughter from the dance class.

Link 12: When it comes to enforcing Sections 4 and 5 of the 1988 Road Traffic Act; It doesn't matter if Michael Henry was travelling. 

If he was in control of a vehicle on a public road, he was "driving", and if he at the same time he was under the influence of alcohol, then he was "drink-driving" - that would apply even if the vehicle was stationary. 

You could be moving at zero miles per hour, with the hand-brake on and the keys in your pocket. If you are over the limit and in charge that vehicle, then you are technically "drink-driving". 

Does that seem unfair? Is it an abuse of your sovereign freedom to travel at will? Does this British law passed 37 years ago infringe your United States Constitutional rights? 

Unlike Sovereign Pete, I do not claim to be a legal scholar, nor have I spent 30 years studying the legal system. But it seems rather unlikely that this argument would be effective in a British Magistrate's court, especially given that Michael doesn't deny that he was drunk whilst operating his car on a public road, nor that he was out of control - running lights. 

But, I doubt he even managed to make that argument: The judge might not have heard a single word of Michael's preposterous pleading: 

> Clip 12 - (Michael Henry Furlong):  So I went into court and I didn't take the name, it's a crime to take the commercial name because it's a crime property. So I asked several times for my rights of subjugation and he just kept ignoring me.

Link 13: By this, I think he means that he refused to give his name to the court, which is a bit of a problem if you're trying to defend yourself — it is literally the first think they ask you when your hearing begins:

"For the record please state your name."

If Michael refuses to confirm his identity, the magistrate will proceed using the name on the charge. If he also refuses to enter a plea, the judge will enter a ‘not guilty’ plea for him and move things along. While Michael would still technically be allowed to offer a defense, the court wouldn’t indulge sovereign citizen nonsense, especially if he had used up all of the judge's patience with his uncooperative antics. 

If Michael had a valid legal defense, he could still present it—, but the magistrate is under no obligation to entertain his pseudo-legal ramblings. A court is not a YouTube comments section; 

Shouting ‘I do not consent’ doesn’t make any of this go away.

> Clip 13 - (Michael Henry Furlong): So he's charged me with guilty, but it's parity because I don't want to take the name, I don't want to be associated with any organisations that are involved in treason and genocide.

Link 14: "Charged with guilty" might be Michael's rather confused way of saying he "Found Guilty". How could it be any other way?

If the judge had come to any other conclusion then this would be literally the first time in British law that a sovereign citizen argument has ever prevailed.

Althaugh, this might happen if the judge had been as drunk as Michael was when he ran that red light, got stopped by the police officer and then claimed to be "travelling, not driving"... 

And this has actually happened, for example consider case of Judge Esther Cunningham:

In November 2006, Judge Cunningham appeared intoxicated while representing her cousin in a case at Grantham Magistrates’ Court. Her behavior included swearing at an usher, insulting a prosecutor, and forcibly kissing another solicitor. These actions resulted in her suspension from practice for six months.

Had Judge Cunningham been in charge that day, I doubt that even she would stand for Michael's tomfoolery:

> Clip 14 - (Michael Henry Furlong): And obviously I'll appeal it, because I wasn't in commerce. It was me to claim I was in commerce. Very term driving in Black Law is someone who's employed. And I resigned from the Crown Corporation as discussed in 2022. So I don't know where, you know, it appears there's no law. You know, he's denying me right there.

Link 15a: Black's Law dictionary, First published in 1891, is a highly regarded reference book for American legal definitions; If an early 20th Century lawyer wanted to know what the word 'Driver' meant, he could turn to this mighty tome and read:

> (Black's Law Dictionary) DRIVER. One employed in conducting a coach, carriage, wagon or other vehicle with horses, mules or other animals.

Link 15b: Clearly, this is a slam-dunk, whatever vehicle, Michael was allegedly not-driving, I think we can be sure that it wasn't powered by a beast of burden. 

And what was this means of travelling, this form of conveyance does it exist in Black's law dictionary? Astonishingly, the first edition of this imposing work of reference has no definition for "car", the closest thing I could find was:

> (Black's Law Dictionary) CARRIAGE. A vehicle used for the transportation of persons either for pleasure or business

Link 15c: Michal was driving to collect his daughter from a dance class - how could that be considered business or pleasure?

And didn't it say that a driver is somebody who is 'employed'?

> (Black's Law Dictionary) EMPLOY. To engage in one's service; to use as an agent or substitute in transacting business; to commission and entrust with the management of one's affairs

Link 15d: Does that sound like Michael Furlong to you? He's not had a job since 2022 when he was sacked from Jaguar Land Rover for refusing to wear a face mask on the assembly-line. Would anybody entrust the management of their affairs to Michael Furlong? Surely not - he can't even collect his own daughter from dance class. He's always drunk.

> Clip 15 - (Michael Henry Furlong): Yeah, so we'll just wait till the case then, now, eh? Yeah, 31st of March. Nice one. Sentence for alleged drink-driving.

Link 16: No, Michael is being sentenced because he has already been convicted of drink-driving. Sentencing doesn’t happen unless you’ve been found guilty—so at this point, there’s nothing ‘alleged’ about it.

A police officer saw him run a red light, forced him to pull over, and then he failed a sobriety test. He's as guilty as they come, and his "defence" probably harmed his case.

Michael is the most clueless man on this planet. I'm going to make a prediction of how this is going to work out: He's not yet twigged that he's been found guilty and is about to be sentenced. But when he finally is sentenced, he's going to think that the Magistrate has only banned his 'legal fiction' from driving.

So I'm going to predict that Michael Furlong, the man will take that sentence and completely ignore it. He will probably drive directly from the court to the pub where he, Phil, George and all the sovereign incels from Liverpool TPR will get completely smashed. 

They will all drive into the night to find who knows what adventure awaits an inebriated man in charge of a vehicle.

> Clip 16 - (Michael Henry Furlong): I don't know what I'm going to do. Obviously, the Crown owned this hearing, so I don't know whether to put an officer's decision on the driver's license, because I don't want to be associated with these criminals. You know, they're killing my people.

Link 17: Perhaps not as many people who are killed by drunk driving. In 2024, the UK government recorded over 4000 collisions caused by drivers who operated a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. From that there were nearly 7000 casualties.

Had it not been for the intervention of that police officer - Michael Furlong might have been one of those casualties. Possibly also his daughter that he was supposed to collect from that dance class. Maybe even the other children, as he ran over their fragile bodies as indiscriminately as he ran that red light.

Michael’s people—and by this, I assume he means ‘drunk drivers’—seem to be responsible for quite a lot of deaths every year. Meanwhile, all of his Liverpool TPR buddies are still alive and well. 

> Clip 17 - (Michael Henry Furlong):  But I think justice is coming. I believe, eh, I believe, eh, the CPS court has just been outlawed in America, and hopefully we'll follow suit. Hopefully, before 31st of March.

Link 18: Well, that's a ray of hope, isn't it? When the United Kingdom becomes the 51st state of America, under the benevolent leadership of the orange god-emperor of mankind, then driving under the influence of alcohol will be legal in the UK, just as apparently it is in the USA. Yay for America and the sensible policies of its new leader.

And before I end this fabulously informative episode of Mind of Steele, here's some other breaking legal news from Isleworth Crown Court in West London. Apparently, Matt Houston, the Hillingdon Vandal is "not guilty" of repeatedly vandalising Transport for London property

-- Houston 'not guilty clip'

Link 19: I will lead you to decide whose legal strategy is the most truly insane? Was it Phil McLoughlin, the "people's lawyer" whose brilliant tactic is to force the police to deliver imaginary documents: If it doesn't exist they must acquit!

Or was it Michael Furlong, who openly admitted to being drunk while in charge of a vehicle—but thinks that doesn’t count because he was not cattle, but children.

Or is it Matt Houston, the grinning legend of stupidity from West London who thinks a British Crown court is going to accept Mark Steele's conspiracy theories as defence for a crime we've watched him commit on his own TikTok channel. 

This is a moral quandary that I think will keep Mind of Steele viewers intellectually occupied for at least a week - which is precisely the time it will take to assemble a new turd-fest of pestilence for your dismay, horror and derision. 

But if you are the sort of person who actually enjoys this potent lunacy, why not give me one of those likes. Over seventeen thousand people 'liked' Matt Houston's stupid instagram video of him claiming to be 'not guilty'. If you like my video then the algorithm is more likely to serve my video than those of the conspiracy nutters we've seen. Just think how much impotent rage your single click of that button can cause.

But, dear friends if mere 'clictivism' doesn't seem like a strong enough response, come over to Mind of Steele Chat, the Telegram channel where the aficionados of the truly unhinged congregate and discuss the latest goings on the the conspiracy-theory metaverse. 

If you feel triggered the latest stupidity from Richard Vobes, then head on over, join our angry huddle and you too can be part of the Mind of Steele innermost clique.

So, that's it for another week. Until next time, please as Innocent as Matt, Phill and Michael Furlong, and please don't drink more than four cans of strong larger before you collect your daughter from dance class.
